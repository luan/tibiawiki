    "bestiarytext": "The Wandering Pillars, akin to their Walking counterparts, are infused with burning darklight that seems to consume and suck in energy and light. These enigmatic entities are rarely seen stationary, as if driven by an eternal restlessness. Their movements are unpredictable, as if guided by an inscrutable will, making them elusive and difficult to track. The air crackles with an otherworldly energy in their proximity, causing distortions in the ambient light and an unnerving sense of disorientation. Some whisper that the Wandering Pillars possess the ability to phase through reality, allowing them to traverse great distances in the blink of an eye. Encountering a Wandering Pillar is a disconcerting experience, leaving observers questioning the true nature of these enigmatic creatures.",
