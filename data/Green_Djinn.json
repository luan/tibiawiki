These magic-wielding enemies of all good embrace destruction and enjoy causing pain. Although only inferior members of the green-skinned race have been sighted until now, they are enemies to beware of.  Their magical tricks make them more than a match for unexpecting adventurers. Despising all living beings and everything that is beautiful, their especially passionate hatred is reserved for their blue-skinned relatives, whom they regard as traitors to djinnkind.",

When Djinns make you [[drunk]], it is '''very hard''' to control your movements. They can make you '''very''' [[drunk]]. A useful way for a sorcerer or druid to kill one is to summon a [[Demon Skeleton]] and to use that to attack and block the djinn and also use [[Ice Strike]] to kill it faster, this is a useful technique as the Demon Skeleton would not take much damage aside from [[Energy Damage|electrical attacks]], so you may need to summon another one every 5-6 djinns. At about level 60 a druid can easily and quickly kill these using just their [[Hailstorm Rod]] and [[Ice Strike]].\nAnother option is running and shooting with [[Avalanche Rune]]."
