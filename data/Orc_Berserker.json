Knights can also use spells like [[Whirlwind Throw]], [[Front Sweep]] and [[Berserk]] to kill Berserkers faster and/or deal with more than one of them at a time. Remember: the longer a Berserker lives, the more damage you take.<br/>\n'''[[Mage]]s''' should consider using [[Magic Shield]] or [[Invisible]]. However, at level 25+ with a decent [[magic level]] it is not hard to just use [[earth]] attacks and [[Intense Healing]] for this creature, but if they do an exceptionally big hit you can always use [[Health Potion|health]]/[[mana potion]]s, [[Halberd]]s make it easy to profit. But be careful with [[Invisibility]], as [[Orc Leader]]s, [[Orc Warlord]]s and [[Orc Shaman]]s can still see you. If you find them together with Orc Shamans, kill the Shamans first so that the summoned [[Snake]]s don't break your [[shielding]] or get in your way. Also a good [[summon]] for Mages, however healing runes may be recommended, since they lose health easily.<br/>\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' Should use a one handed weapon and a shield to hunt them and should consider using [[Energy Ring|Energy]] and [[Stealth Ring]]s for the same reason why Mages should use Magic Shield or Invisible. While [[Bows]] and [[Crossbows]] can give Paladins extra range to deal with Berserkers before they get close it leaves them very vulnerable to the Berserker's powerful melee attack, should one live long enough to traverse the distance between you and him. Always have your best healing spell or potion ready in case of a big hit."
