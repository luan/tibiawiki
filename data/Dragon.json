    "history": "Dragons are one of the oldest creatures in the game. In older times (prior to 2001 at least) dragons were [[Summon Creature|summonable]], and during these times it was possible to summon up to 8 creatures at once (even through requiring very high [[mana]]) and only the highest leveled [[mage]]s could summon them (back then the highest [[level]]s were only around level 60 or 70). It was a somewhat common occurrence to see mages walking the streets of [[Thais]] with several dragons summoned at one time. It was also possible to set summons free by logging out of the game, turning the summons into wild creatures. Often mages would leave the game after summoning as many as 8 dragons in the middle of major [[Hometowns|cities]], causing chaos.",

    "strategy": "'''All''' [[player]]s should stand diagonal from the dragon, whenever possible, to avoid the [[Fire Wave]].\n \n'''[[Knight]]s''': Only one knight should be present in a team hunt, as they, the [[Blocking|blocker]], must be able to move freely around the dragon and to maintain their diagonal position as the dragon takes a step. It is quite easy for a knight of [[level]] 40 or higher to block a dragon without using any Health Potions at all. Around level 60 a knight with good skills (70/70) can hunt dragons with little waste and possibly profit. Remember to stand diagonal to it and always be prepared to use [[Health Potion|potions]]. A level 80+ knight can hunt dragons using only food and [[Pair of Soft Boots|Soft Boots]].<br />\n'''[[Mage]]s''' of level 28 or higher can kill dragons without help from other players, but you need to be very careful. They can [[Summon]] two [[Demon Skeleton]]s and drink a few extra [[Mana Potion]]s afterwards. They should try to keep enough [[mana]] to heal, if needed. They should enter, lure the dragon out, attack it with the demon skeletons, then move to a different floor so the dragon will target the demon skeletons. It is advisable to move to a space about 3 squares diagonal and use a strike spell ([[Ice Strike]] if possible) or [[Icicle Rune]]s to kill faster. Heal when your hit points drop below 250-280. Druids level 35 or higher, can use [[Mass Healing]] to prevent their summons from dying, otherwise use [[Healing Runes]]. This is a reasonably cheap way to hunt dragons although the demon skeletons also gain a share of the experience.<br />\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' with a distance skill of 60+ and enough hit points to survive a fire attack are welcome additions to a team dragon hunt. Just be sure to have the [[Divine Healing]] spell ready to use, and stand where you can also escape if the dragon retargets. A paladin's ability to solo a dragon depends greatly on the terrain. A dragon's melee is weaker than their area attacks, so it would be advisable to stand diagonal the Dragon but only 1 sqm away, while shooting [[Royal Spear]]s or [[Enchanted Spear]]s. A level 20 paladin with skills 65+ may attempt to solo a single dragon spawn but will have to bring some potions. Killing a dragon at this level will only prove your strength as a paladin will spend approximately 500 [[gp]]s per dragon and the chance of dying is very high if not careful. It is advisable to bring some [[Icicle Rune|Icicles]] or [[Avalanche Rune]]s if facing two or more of them."
