He, his brothers [[Arthei]], [[Lersatio]], and [[Boreth]], and Arthei's wife [[Kala]], travelled to [[Yalahar]] in order to find a new home. From that moment on Marziel started keeping a [[Arthei's Descent into Vampirism I (Book)|diary]]. From the first part of this diary it becomes clear that he used to have a girlfriend named [[Melava]].<br>He is the third boss you will encounter during the [[Blood Brothers Quest]]. To access the boss' room, a female character needs to walk in front of the ''big throne with a vampire lord on it'' and then throw blood on the carpet. Two [[Vampire Bride]]s will appear, after killing one you are teleported to the boss room. If you are fast enough going back to the room where you killed the [[Vampire Bride]], you can loot the body. Also, if you manage to kill both [[Vampire Bride]]s at the same time the loot from both will appear in server log, but when you return to the room there will be only one body.<br>You will receive [[The Dust of Marziel]] when you use a [[Blessed Wooden Stake]] on his dead body.",
