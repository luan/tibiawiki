Although this theory remains unconfirmed, it would help to explain the burning rage that seems to be a common trait of all Crypt Shamblers. Whatever the truth, Crypt Shamblers are dangerous undead that far exceed many other undead in power and ferocity.",

They can do alot of damage so be sure to have [[Health Potion]]s with you.<br />\n\n'''[[Paladin]]s''': Run while attacking them with any distance attack. Beware not to come too close to these since they can do a high damage in close combat. Experienced paladins are advised to kill them using [[Divine Missile]]s or [[Divine Caldera]] in the case they come in group. Since they are usually found with [[Mummy|Mummies]], [[Bonelord]]s and other [[Undead]], it is recommended to take priority on the Crypt Shamblers since they are strong when in close combat. A good place to hunt these is in [[Yalahar]], [[Cemetery Quarter]].<br />\n\n'''[[Mage]]s''': Should keep distance from them while attacking with their [[wand]]/[[rod]] and shooting [[Fire Damage|fire]], [[Energy Damage|energy]] or [[Ice Damage]] [[rune]]s or spells. Don't let them come too close because their attacks can kill a [[mage]] easily. Can start hunting these as low as [[level]] 15, but are commonly found with [[Mummy|mummies]] (or other [[undead]]) so take care when doing so."
