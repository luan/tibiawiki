    "bestiarytext": "The Darklight Striker is a creature formed of rock and unlight, bound to an unstable existence that defies conventional understanding. Legends speak of these elusive entities dispersing at random, only to reform in another location, leaving observers puzzled by their enigmatic nature. Darklight pulses within their core, resonating with chaotic energy, and their stony exteriors are etched with jagged cracks, hinting at the volatile forces contained within. The Darklight Strikers move with an unnatural grace, their movements accompanied by discharges of dark energy that crackle and writhe. Their attacks are swift and devastating, as they harness the destructive potential of the darklight to unleash a barrage of ethereal assaults upon their foes. While accounts of their transient nature persist, the true nature of the Darklight Strikers remains shrouded in mystery, leaving those who encounter them in awe of their enigmatic existence.",
