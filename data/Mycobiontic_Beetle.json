    "bestiarytext": "The Mycobiontic Beetles are creatures that have not only adapted but thrived in the decaying aura of the putrid realm over countless generations. These beetles possess an otherworldly resilience and ferocity, making them a formidable force in the fallen realm. Their exoskeletons shimmer with an eerie iridescence, hinting at the corruption that permeates their bodies. Through their prolonged exposure to the decaying essence of the realm, these beetles have absorbed its malevolent energy, making them next to natural monsters in their power and tenacity. They scuttle through the desolate landscapes, their chitinous shells resonating with the ominous whispers of the decaying realm, as they hunt and seek to further their dominance in this nightmarish realm.",
