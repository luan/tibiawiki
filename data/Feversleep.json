From their brief glimpses of it, the inquisitors surmise a feversleep may be an adolescent form of a terrorsleep, or maybe the decrepit, old age stage at the end of a terrorsleep's days. The only thing that can be said with some certainty is that feversleeps are somehow related to the terrorsleeps, in whose company they are often seen.<br /><br />Feversleeps emit a strange, sweaty heat. When victims draw near, feversleeps often cloak themselves in shadow, becoming invisible, detectable only by their foul stench and a strange weakening effect they have on their prey, distorting their prey's sense of time and draining its powers so they can feed on it.<br /><br />Feversleeps love cool water, and are often seen next to pools or rivers, preferably underground in a dark and dank cavern. They have been seen mainly in Upper Roshamuul and are maybe attracted to ruins of ancients settlements, or may have had another purpose when the ruins were still inhabited. However, no one so far ever ventured to investigate closer, as the feversleeps are a promise of a slow, horrible end in the throes of deathly hallucinations, for all that stay too long in their vicinity.",
