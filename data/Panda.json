It is just as strong as other bears, and the only major difference to its conspecifics is its habitat. Panda bears that were caught and shipped to Thais died quickly and even though magic was used, no Panda survived more than a week away from its home. It is found most often in the southern regions of Tiquanda. Considering that they share their territory with the vile dworcs and other savage creatures, it is quite obvious that they are fierce fighters.",
