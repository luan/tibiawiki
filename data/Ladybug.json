    "bestiarytext": "The unassuming Ladybug seems harmless enough. When left alone to mind their own business, they tend the eggs, repair the delicate structures of the hive and feed other Hive Born creatures with biomass. They do this quite peacefully and without any haste or urgency. When confronted with strangers, though, the Ladybugs show an aggressiveness that rivals that of their bigger brethren and belies their unassuming appearance. They are probably the least dangerous of the Hive Born and are quite territorial. Ladybugs live only for about a week and decay quite fast into a mass that can be easily devoured by other hive creatures or absorbed by the hive. Sometimes they sacrifice themselves and die seemingly on purpose to heal wounded hive structures. Astonishingly enough, unlike other hive creatures, Ladybugs show no great difference in their behaviour when separated from the hive for an extended period of time. While other creatures become increasingly aggressive and eventually mutilate themselves or simply wither and die, the Ladybugs show no such behaviour. Quite the contrary, Ladybugs separated from the hive are reported to live considerably longer and behave more like the common giant bugs. That lets scientists believe that Ladybugs may not be hive creatures per se but a creature that lives in some kind of symbiosis with the hive. Only occasionally, Ladybugs take part in the war against the Deeplings, mainly when the hive needs to be defended.",
