Though not very strong, they seek to harm adventurers in their mean, petty ways, and will stalk them until slain. Tarnished spirits relish in the gloom of crypts, graveyards and other places of death, although they are often driven out to the borders by stronger undead creatures, where they linger and wait for prey.",
