Fire Bombs and Walls can come in handy to keep them away. At level 130+ can solo these creatures 2 by 2, and at 150+ you could hunt them with no problem, but be careful not to get trapped, always carry fire runes for emergency or precaution.\n-Knights lower than level 130 should avoid to face more than 2 at a time. It's recommended level 150+ and skills 95/95 to hunt them without problems. Get some ultimate health potions with you and try to kill them fast using berserk and fierce berserk."
