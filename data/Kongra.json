They seem to be the warriors of the apes that live in the deepest jungle and raid the human settlements from time to time. In its anger a Kongra is able to rip out small trees and to break bones as if they weretwigs. The sight of an enraged, storming Kongra can make even an experienced warrior tremble. The dark and massive figure reaches a threatening speed in its attacks. Relying mainly on its strength, a Kongra rarely uses any weapons. Occasionally, the ape warrior uses stones of different sizes or branches as makeshift weapons, but usually it relies on its hammer-like fists and the clout of its powerful arms.",

Not really worth the effort as they have very high hitpoints and take too much mana/runes considering the little exp they yield.<br />\n'''[[Knight]]s''' should not have much trouble with Kongras, but they will break your [[shielding]] while the [[sibang]]s attack you with [[Small Stone|stones]].<br />\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' should use trees to run in circles and shoot them down, or get a shield and a throwing weapon, and run in circles around them."
