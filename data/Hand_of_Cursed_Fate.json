It is sure though that its existence is fuelled by powerful demonic forces. Living or animated, it is a fast and powerful minion in the demonic ranks. Yet obviously lacking a head, the creature is quite cunning and loves dirty surprise attacks. It usually attacks with individual fingers, but it is also said that the Hand of Cursed Fate sometimes grasps an opponent to crush it in its powerful grip. Its greatest pleasure is to bring pain and despair to others. Above all it enjoys the suffering of creatures. The Hand of Cursed Fate is attracted by those whom it senses as doomed and takes greatest amusement in their demise. Therefore it is a powerful adversary, and it is no mockery when it is claimed that the Hand of Cursed Fate can pull some dirty tricks out of its sleeve.",

This may be tricky though since it can disappear, and you have to find it with [[Runes]]. So, that [[Knight]] must try to lure it in a place where it can't move, and then spam it with [[Ice Damage|Ice]] and [[Holy Damage|Holy-Based]] [[Spells]]. Note though that when using [[Haste]], the creature can become extremely fast, about the speed of a level 650+ so don't expect to chase it until it has slowed down. Try to trap the creature with a [[Knight]] blocker and possibly some [[Wild Growth]]s."
