You may consider to use [[Invisibility]] or a [[Stealth Ring]] if there are many [[Minotaurs]], as only the Minotaur Mages can see invisible players.<br />\n'''[[Mages]]''': with a decent [[Magic Level]] (around 35), can kill them easily by just rushing in and using [[Ice Damage]] spells. This stratagy kills them quickly, and uses very little [[Mana]].<br /> \n'''[[Knight]]s''' with a weapon skill of about 55 can kill them in under 5 hits with a decent weapon (e.g. [[Dwarven Axe]]). Watch out for the [[Energy Field]] spell they cast which can cause great damage if you don't pay attention, along with the potentially fatal [[Fireball]]."
