Like snakes, which they are assumed to worship, they like to wait until their victim shows a weakness that allows them to strike. Keeping their enemies at distance, their sudden attacks often take the victims by surprise which gives the Lizard Snakecharmers an edge in combat. Recently, they have settled their quarrels with the warriors of their race to form a formidable team to fight against their common enemy and to fend off any intruders in their territory.",
