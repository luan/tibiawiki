Since he's resistant to all other elements, the best you can do is to use [[Explosion]]s or [[Physical Strike]]s.<br />\n\nA basic strategy consists of the [[Knight]] blocking the '''Black Knight''' and [[Challenge]]s it whenever it retargets, while the [[Druid]]/[[Sorcerer]] uses the above. But the most efficient duo-strategy to kill it faster would be a [[Knight]] blocking while a [[Paladin]] uses [[Divine Missile]]s.\nNot a good creature to do a fast hunt on since he takes quite some time to [[respawn]] (around 10 minutes with regards to the [[Respawn|server state]]).\nIt is possible for a [[Paladin]] to solo this creature at level 50. It is reccomended that you take either [[Royal Spear]]s or [[Enchanted Spear]]s and a good [[Shields|shield]], though you should kill the [[Bonelord]]s first to avoid mana drain. If you can, also kill the [[Scorpion]]s too. This will dramatically increase your chances of succeeding.",
