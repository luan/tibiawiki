Some people say that the Nightmare Scions are a completely different breed than the nightmares, others claim that they are the same breed, only weaker due to injuries or some sort of demonic disease. A common theory states that the Nightmare Scions are the prototype of the actual nightmare. Just like this theory, also another one assumes that nightmares do not breed, but that all nightmares come into existence through the same process. Those creatures that do not possess  the full amount of power turn into Nightmare Scions. It is not known, yet if Nightmare Scions can become true nightmares by ageing or maybe by accumulating power in some way. They are usually found in the company of nightmares and seem to get along with each other quite well for demonic races.<br />What a Nightmare Scion lacks in raw power, it tries to make up with wickedness. They are exceptionally cruel and love to prey on weaker foes. In general, they occur in great numbers to be safe. This seems not only to combine their power but also their wickedness. Nightmare Scions love to stalk their victims in the shadow for hours. Making sure they get noticed by their prey, they seem to feed on the fear they arouse. After some while, the Nightmare Scions will begin to slowly attack their victims until the whole force will swarm around the prey. Victims of Nightmare Scions can be easily recognised by the fear frozen into their dead faces.",
