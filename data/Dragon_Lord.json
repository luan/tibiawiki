    "strategy": "A common strategy involves a [[knight]] blocking while several [[Paladin]]s and/or [[Mage]]s stay as far away as possible from the creature while shooting bolts and or runes. [[Mage]]s can also summon [[Demon Skeleton|demon skeletons]] to block the creature as they are not affected by fire. Knights when blocking are advised to stand diagonally to the dragon lord to avoid the fire wave attack; a practice often called ''dancing with the dragon''; although it is no display of affection.\n<br>\nIf you are on a non-pvp world, a [[Knight]] and a [[Druid]] can hunt like this in big spawns (such as Pits of Inferno Dragon Lair):\n<br>\nThe knight lures a few DLs, and keeps standing at one spot. The [[Druid]] has to stand a certain number of squares away from him, and, using [[Ice Wave]] or [[Strong Ice Wave]], hit all the DLs that are attacking the knight, also healing the knight with [[exura sio]]. LOTS of experience can be obtained like this in a short time.\n<br><br>\nHigher level players can solo dragon lords in different ways as set out below.\n<br><br>\n'''[[Knight]]s''' 60+ can use melee and [[Exori]]-spells, healing as required. But it is hard to profit since a great number of [[Mana Potion]]s would be used.\n<br><br>\n'''[[Mage]]s''' (recommended [[Level]] 45+) can use attacks like [[Ice Strike]] or [[Icicle (Rune)|Icicles]] to kill dragon lords, supported by some [[Avalanche (Rune)|Avalanches]] when they are trying to run away, since they're weak against this element. Alternatively they can summon [[Demon Skeleton]]s to keep the dragon lord at a distance and shoot runes. Keep in mind that the dragon lord will kill the [[Demon Skeleton]]s quite fast, so you should be bringing a few healing runes, alternatively summon a new one. For mages below [[Level]] 60, it is recommended to use [[Magic Shield]] and always stand diagonal. <br><br>\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' (recommended [[level]] 55+) can shoot bolts or [[Ethereal Spear]]s while running to avoid the fire waves and melee attacks. Depending on your level and skill level, it is recommended to bring a decent amount of pots whether you're going to just kill one or hunt them. <br>\n\nA good spot to '''solo your first Dragon Lord''' is in a [https://tibia.fandom.com/wiki/Mapper?coords=127.207-122.1-7-4-1-1 hill] of the [[Arena and Zoo Quarter|Yalahar Zoo]], there is only one. <br>"
