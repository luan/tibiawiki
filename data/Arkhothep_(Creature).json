The pharaoh is both the high priest and the primary deity of an obscure cult that celebrates the [[undead]] as the key to immortality. The pharaoh has filled the basement of his own palace with [[skeleton]]s and other [[undead]] [[creature]]s, so that those who are still mortal can see the glory of being undead for themselves. He was summoned on the Winter Test Server of 2006 by [[Knightmare]] as well as the Summer Test Servers of 2010 and 2012.\n<gallery caption=\"\" captionalign=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\" position=\"center\" hideaddbutton=\"true\" mode=\"nolines\">\nArkhothep (Creature) 2006.jpg|Arkhothep and his summoner, [[Knightmare]], as seen in 2006.\n</gallery>",
