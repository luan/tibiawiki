Unlike the male raiders, who either are quite gifted in magic or lack this talent completely, some women show some kind of inherent magic. Their talent is not strong enough to call the more powerful spirits, but they have a special knack to handle animals and to heal wounds which can only be explained with magic. With some training they are able to conjure some animal spirits and lead them into battle. Even though their magical abilities are quite limited, they can also use their powers in several destructive ways to defend themselves. Under the shaman queen, it has become more and more common that only shamans utterly loyal to her receive a formal and extensive training. For this reason the ranks of the Barbarian Brutetamers have been boosted with some truly gifted women who will probably never be able to use the full power of their potential. Still the Barbarian Brutetamers are absolutely loyal to their clans and tribes and they will use everything at their disposal to strike down the enemies of their cold-hearted queen.",

Try not to be surrounded by the [[War Wolf|War Wolves]] or other barbarians if you miss some attacks and always carry some potions if you life goes low.<br>[[Knights]]: should try to charge straight at these creatures, before they get a chance to summon, also try not to follow them too far, as you will meet more [[Barbarians]] and you can get trapped. If there are more than one, try luring one away then charging with full attack."
