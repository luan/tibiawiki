    "notes": "[[The Abomination]] is a raid boss that spawns approximately every 180 days. When this raid happens, it starts with the [[Abominable Spawn]] appearing in 4 out of 10 possible locations. The miniboss on the 4 locations share the same health pool and it seems to be required to have players in all rooms to defeat it. The remaining portals will bring you to empty rooms. The possible locations are:\n\n* '''Hellgate''': go down the hole {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.191|123.106|13|2|1|0.50.5}} and down two more levels to find the portal {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.189|123.124|15|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n* '''Dark Cathedral''': go to the undead creatures are east of the entrance, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.199|126.112|8|2|1|0.50.5}}, then go south to find the portal {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.228|126.179|9|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n* '''Krailos''': inside the Wailing Widow's {{Mapper Coords|text=cave|131.150|124.1|7|1|1|11}} on the second floor {{Mapper Coords|text=here|131.129|124.39|9|4|1|0.250.25}}.\n* '''Zao Steppe''': inside the Lancer Beetle's {{Mapper Coords|text=cave|129.197|122.166|7|1|1|11}} on the second floor, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|129.192|122.174|10|4|1|0.250.25}}. (You need part of [[A Father's Burden Quest]] to enter here).\n* '''Gnomebase Alpha''': go down the ramp to the [[Mushroom Gardens]] near the portal to the Warzones, then down again and the portal will be to the west, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|128.134|124.163|11|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n* '''Ankrahmun''': Enter the Larvae cave {{Mapper Coords|text=here|129.129|127.175|7|1|1|11}} and go down to the lowest floor with Scarabs, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|129.75|127.176|11|4|1|0.250.25}}.\n* '''Beregar''': from the Wagon room at the mines, go down, through the south door and down again, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.97|123.26|15|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n* '''Edron Cyclopolis''': All they towards the main Behemoths area, then to the south corridor and up the ramp, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|130.21|124.11|14|4|1|0.250.25}}.\n* '''Svargrond Formorgar Mines''': Take the elevator to the third floor of the mines, then go down the stairs next to it and go south-east, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|125.247|121.188|12|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n* '''Kazordoon Dwarf Mines''': Enter the mine between the river streams, {{Mapper Coords|text=here|127.28|124.198|7|2|1|0.50.5}}, and go down several floors until you reach the teleport {{Mapper Coords|text=here|126.254|124.199|13|2|1|0.50.5}}.\n\nOnce the [[Abominable Spawn]] is defeated, its corpse will become a vortex that brings players to the lair of The Abomination. Only through the 4 original portals where the Spawn was present it will be possible to reach The Abomination.",
