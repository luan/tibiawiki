If one of the [[Fetter]]s is alive, the boss will not take any damage, thus the Fetters must be killed as quickly as possible. The best way to do this is to position the players in a way that the boss never moves when it change forms and also that both Fetters get hit simultaneously when a [[Great Fireball Rune]] is thrown at the center of the room. This way, damage to one of them will always be dealt when the runes are thrown and no attack turns will be wasted.",
