    "strategy": "The fight can be split into two moments - with and without [[Primal Pack Beast]] summons.\n\nDuring the fight without [[Primal Pack Beast]]s a [[Knight]] should keep the boss at the middle of the room and shooters stay around the room to observe the environment for spawning [[Primal Pod]]s and [[Primal Pack Beast]]s - besides shooters should simply strike the boss with [[Sudden Death Rune]]s. It is advised for [[Paladin]]s to use bow with [[Diamond Arrow]] to avoid changing the bow and crossbow during the fight to minimize the risk of losing attack turns. Mages should preserve their [[Hell's Core]] and [[Eternal Winter]] spells for the summons.\n\nAny time a [[Primal Pod]] spawns, anybody nearby (including the [[Knight]]) should run and step on it immediately - otherwise a [[Fungosaurus]] will spawn,  which will decrease your chances of completing the boss significantly.\n\nAt some point the boss will start to summon [[Primal Pack Beast]]s. Shooters have to be careful and attempt to run to the opposite side of the room from the spawning summon (to not get the agro at all) while the [[Knight]] should go closer to the spawning [[Primal Pack Beast]] and challenge it as soon as possible. Once done the [[Knight]] should attempt to return to the middle of the room.\n\n'''Moments with [[Primal Pack Beast]] summons'''\n\nWhen this happens, the shooters should focus on AoE damage. The rune used should be [[Great Fireball Rune]]s. [[Sorcerer]]s should wave the box with his fire and energy waves while [[Druid]]s should use their [[Terra Wave]] as frequently as possible as you have approximately 10 turns to kill the [[Primal Pack Beast]] - otherwise it will transform into [[Fungosaurus]]. The terra wave of [[Druid]] is not effective to [[The Primal Menace]], nevertheless it works fine against [[Primal Pack Beast]]s and [[Fungosaurus]]es and it should be your priority to kill it as fast as possible. \n\nIt is advised that one of the team members pay special attention to the time of killing the summons - and if there are chances that one of these will transform into a [[Fungosaurus]] the mages should cast their [[Hell's Core]] and/or [[Eternal Winter]] spells immediately.\n\nIt may also happen that you won't be able to kill the summons on time and a [[Fungosaurus]] will spawn in place of not killed [[Primal Pack Beast]]. It is a quite critical situation for the team - the [[Knight]] loses his mobility as the [[Fungosaurus]] causes [[Feared]] status, so that [[Knight]] has to use [[Fire Bomb Rune]] to avoid randomly running. Summons will keep spawning so it's fully on shooters now to lure the [[Primal Pack Beast]]s to the blocker. \n\n''Note'': The [[Knight]] has also to pay extra attention as Primal Pods that appear near him will clear any field from bombs, so they might need to be renewed to avoid random running due to the [[Feared]] status.\n\n'''Before you go''':\n\n# The less health points [[The Primal Menace]] has (or the higher hazard level), the more it will spawn [[Primal Pack Beast]] summons and [[Primal Pod]]. \n# It is advised to leave the boss room if you have more than 1 [[Fungosaurus]] in the fight - otherwise you're highly risking death of some or all members of the team.\n# Shooters should wear [[Shockwave Amulet]] and [[Might Ring]] during all the fight.\n# [[Sorcerer]]s and [[Druid]]s should be on constant [[Magic Shield]]. Do not hesitate to use [[Blessed Steak]], [[Blueberry Cupcake]] or [[Consecrated Beef]] to refill your mana if it goes below approximately 10% - otherwise you risk losing your attack turns and therefore increase the risk of spawning [[Fungosaurus]].\n# Once [[The Primal Menace]] is killed, its summons and any [[Fungosaurus]] disappear, but existing Pods do not. These will still become Fungusaurus if not dealt with, so make sure to step on them or leave quickly.\n# If the whole fight goes smoothly it should take between 2 and 5 minutes.",
