If possible, get at least 2 Master Sorcerer's who can shoot [[Sudden Death Rune]]s, because of the massive death damage this creature takes. A royal paladin or an elder druid would come in handy, to either inflict damage, or heal the blocker with [[Heal Friend]]. Irahsae is not too strong, but the blocker could take considerably high combos of up to 700 damage, maybe more. An Elite Knight of level 55 and higher with good skills and a good set should be able to survive blocking this monster us [[Strong Health Potion]]s. Amount of waste will depend on how fast the shooters can bring it down. Once it starts to run, make sure all mages shoot Sudden Death at Irahsae before it hides and heal.",
