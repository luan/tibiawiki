Heal the blocker and throw all the fire, ice, energy and earth spells you have at it.<br />\n'''Knights and Paladins''': Since this creature is immune to [[Physical Damage]], you'll have a hard time killing it. It's advised to throw several [[Fire Bomb Rune|Fire Bomb]]s on the floor next to each other and then make Teneshpar chase you back and forth on the middle row. Also bring some [[Great Fireball Rune]]s to deal some extra damage. If the fire fields get weaker, just cover them with some new Fire Bombs. Knights and Paladins of level 130 or above killing Teneshpar during [[Devovorga's Essence Mini World Change]] should wear [[Firewalker Boots]] (PvP) to minimise the damage they take from their fields.",
