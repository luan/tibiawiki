Each of them had his own special field. One was a master of manipulating all kinds of ore with his bare mind, another was able to wield powerful energies, and again another would know how to use the strangest of substances in Tibia to his benefit. All of them combined their knowledge to create their own loyal servants. Several prototypes were made. Some constructed of metal, others of gold or even diamond but all of them were based on flesh and bone. Some of them were faulty from the start. It is said that one of the mages even used whole armies of servants to take care of his experiments.",
