In the best case scenario, you will summon a monster that will reach Terofar before you do, so he's the one to be inflicted with a curse. If that doesn't work, you should keep an eye on the death hits you get and once it starts hitting over 300, you may want to put an [[Energy Ring]] again until the curse is gone. Keep Terofar on diagonal all the time, so you can avoid his waves, keep summoning [[Fire Devil]]s in case they die, and just shoot it down with your [[Wand of Defiance]]/[[Glacial Rod]] and [[Sudden Death Rune]]s. It will take around 10 minutes before it dies even if you are a high level.\nIt's also wise to carry few [[Mastermind Potion]]s along and drink one of them each time you failed to react fast enough and got yourself hitted with Skill lowering wave.\n<br />'''Paladins:''' You can start killing it pretty smooth around 400 level. Just stay on diagonal, keep on using [[Sharpshooter]] along with [[Great Spirit Potion]]s and shoot it down with [[Infernal Bolt]]s, [[Sudden Death Rune]]s and occasional [[Strong Ethereal Spear]]. Remember to heal yourself to full before casting each [[Sharpshooter]]. It's also wise to carry [[Energy Ring]] and [[Pot of Blackjack]]/[[Rotworm Stew]] in case things go south and you can't overheal the damage you get.\n<br />'''Knights:''' It's totally or at least nearly impossible to kill it as a [[Knight]]. Better ask your fellow friends with other vocation to do it for you.",
