They are sent to breach the [[Underground Glooth Factory]] Plant, and will do so unchallenged. The Moohtant Wallbreaker will walk directly west until he reaches the plant. He will push all players in his way backward, walk over all fields, magic walls and wild growth trees. He will stand on his allies if he must, although they surprisingly get out unharmed.",
