Be careful when luring away because if you get trapped by them the only way out is to have someone come take them off of you - the spawns will heal themselves and all other monsters around them, you cannot reasonably expect to kill your way out of a trap.\n\nMake sure '''all''' [[Spawn of the Welter|spawns]] are lured away from the boss and that they will not roam around. If a spawn roams and finds you killing the boss, they will heal it back to full health very quickly.\n\nOnce the spawns are away from the boss, focus all your firepower on it.\n\nIt is soloable by luring the spawns away from the boss. However, due to the difficulty of that and the chance of spawns roaming to you, it is strongly recommend you bring a group.\n<br>will heal itself once on red hp and a message will appear,while a [[Spawn of the Welter]] will disappear :{{Message|type=sound|<the welter devours his spawn and heals himself>|}}",
