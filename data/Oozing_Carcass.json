    "bestiarytext": "The Oozing Carcasses are wretched beings that were once fervent followers of the blood god. Now reduced to rotting shells, their existence is sustained by the remnants of a twisted, semi-sentient decay. Within their decrepit forms, a murky ichor oozes incessantly, a grotesque manifestation of the unholy influence that has befallen them. These semi-living monstrosities shuffle through the desolate landscapes, their movements accompanied by a nauseating squelching sound. While their minds have been reduced to fragmented memories and impulses, the Oozing Carcasses still retain a flicker of their former loyalty, instinctively drawn to areas of concentrated decay where they gather in macabre communion.",
