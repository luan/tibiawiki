Bring your best weapon and shield, as Morik hits quite hard, it's best to fight him in balance as he tends to hit for quite some damage, exori whenever he summons a gladiator to hit both at the same time, DO NOT LET HIM HAVE 2 SUMMONS!!! 2 summons will break your shielding quite easily and Morik will hit you for major damage, make sure to bring him down fast or you will waste many potions.<br>",
