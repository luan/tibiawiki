Because the scripting of the Mad Mage became complicated which led to bugs, Cip decided to remove the Mad Mage from Tibia for some time, to reprogram the scripting of the Mad Mage correctly. See {{Post|35529957|Mirade's post on this topic}}.\n\nThe roleplaying consequence of this issue was the (temporarily) implementation of the NPC [[Sane Mage]], the sane version of the Mad Mage. During this time, [[Guide NPCs]] would say \"''The strange tower with the servants on Edron currently seems to be completely impassable because of a severe slime outbreak.''\" instead of their usual answer, when asked about [[Their Master's Voice|Master's Voice]].",
