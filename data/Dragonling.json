    "bestiarytext": "The Dragonling is a remote cousin of the known dragons. Though sharing many traits with the dragons and sometimes seemingly getting along with each other, the Dragonling has many biological distinctions which imply that any relations to dragons are remote indeed. Above all, they share a number of traits and organs with mammals, which has led many researchers to believe that the Dragonling might rather be an artificial chimera or construct instead. Extinct creator races as well as the ancient Yalahari are named as possible origins of the Dragonlings. Whatever the real origins of the Dragonling, it is evident that today it reproduces on its own and has preferred habitats. After mating, a Dragonling lays a dozen eggs in a hidden nest at some warm or preferably hot place. It leaves the nest alone for about a year, only to return when the eggs are ready to hatch. Often it finds its nest destroyed or the eggs gone due to the actions of other creatures. If there are eggs left, they will hatch as soon as the mother is there, seemingly recognising her proximity. The young will then follow their mother who will feed and protect them for several years until they are roughly the same size as their mother. Only a fifth of the Dragonling population is male. The males will leave the clan and only seek out other Dragonlings in mating season. The females and young form wandering clans, sometimes blending with others. Membership of a clan seems more a matter of choice rather than of birth. Unlike true dragons the Dragonlings will not hoard gold, even though they are obviously fascinated by its glittering. For that reason valuable items and coins end up being devoured by the Dragonling. The Dragonlings display snakelike abilities when swallowing objects greater than their mouth would usually allow. It is known that a slain Dragonling which was sliced open was found with a complete, mostly undamaged candelabrum in its belly.",
