    "strategy": "'''To all vocations:''' The use of [[Garlic Necklace]] is recommended. Even though he has many hit points, he is quite easy to defeat with a 45+ [[character]]. His self healing is really troublesome (you could end up doing 8000 damage while Koshei heals 5000 hp, before you defeat him).<br />'''[[Mage]]s''' should stay away and using their [[wand]]/[[rod]] and [[Exori flam]] or [[GFB]] runes since fire is [[Koshei]]'s weakness. He sometimes does high [[damage]] so [[Mana shield]] is recommended for [[Mage]]s around [[level]] 45.<br />'''[[Paladin]]s''' stay away while shooting bolts / arrows / throwing weapons and [[Exori San]] ([[Holy Damage]]). Some [[Health Potion]]s would be good. Make sure to have enough mana for [[Exura]], as the [[Bonebeast]] can [[Paralyze]] you.<br />'''[[Knight]]s''' will have a very hard time with this one, as he has many life draining attacks, coupled with the fast healing. Not recommended for Knights under level 70 ([[Fierce Berserk]]), unless you are experienced. It's also recommended to bring a shooter to help with the killing. As a knight a 20-40 [[Mana Potion]]s and a few [[Strong Health Potion]]s are needed as he hits hard. Also a good idea to wear a [[Garlic Necklace]], as it has many [[Life Drain]] attacks.<br />'''Note:''' that he will respawn shortly after you've killed him, unless you know what to do.\n{{JSpoiler|Part of the [[Koshei The Deathless Quest]]. Can only be successfully defeated if you use the [[Koshei's Ancient Amulet]] on his corpse.}}",
