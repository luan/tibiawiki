The most prominent feature of a Cyclops Drone are its four muscular arms. They are stronger and more persistent than the ordinary cyclops, though they lack considerably on intelligence. They are usually calm, but their fellow cyclopes train and condition them in order to ensure that their passive attitude changes quickly when facing one of the 'lesser' races. Conditioned Cyclops Drones usually attack on sight. Fortunately, they hardly seem to understand what they are doing and therefore rarely use the full strength of their imposing arms. Still, the sheer force of a thoughtless blow can crush bones and break weapons and armour. Cyclops Drones are not numerous, and as they are also not much valued among the cyclops, they are usually found deep underground working under supervision of other cyclops.",

Bow is not advised because of their distance melee attacks, so you may better use shield and throwing weapons.<br />\n[[Mages]]: Try to keep a little distance from them as their melee is quite strong. If you are a [[Druid]] try to use [[Terra Rod|Terra rod]] or, if possible, [[Springsprout Rod]] as they are weak to [[earth damage|Earth Damage]]."
