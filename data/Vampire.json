    "strategy": "A team for a vampire hunt can consist of one knight of about level 30, plus a couple of shooters.  More shooters and better skills will make vampires less expensive to hunt, but you probably will not break even until you get a [[Vampire Shield]]. The success or failure of a vampire hunt depends on luck. The vampire shield is a great loot item for a relatively easy creature, but you may find yourself trying for weeks to loot one.<br>   Everything from these creatures are rare drops, you will be hunting for awhile to get anything from these hard-hitting monsters, so there is a high chance it's gonna be a waste if you don't bring a [[Blessed Wooden Stake]]. If you are attempting to solo a vampire by running it, you need to be ready to heal yourself to cure paralysis.  Since you can no longer cure paralysis with potions keep a close eye on your health and mana. It's best to use exura since they paralyze you often.<br>'''[[Mages]]''' can easily solo them from level 35 and up. [[Druid]]s can use [[Hailstorm Rod]] and [[Flame Strike]], and use [[Exura]] when their [[health]] goes below 310. Sorcerers could do the same with [[Wand of Inferno]], but more effectivelly, as Vampires are weak to [[Fire Damage]]. Keep [[Exura Gran]] ready at all times, as a combo can take away most of a Mage's health in one shot.If you are hunting in a tomb, be careful not to run into creatures that might trap you. <br>'''[[Knights]]''' with 80+ [[skills]] can solo vampires relatively easily (with a [[Barbarian Arena Quest|Barbarian Arena - Scrapper Mode]] weapon)<br>'''[[Paladins]]''' can solo them using [[Exura]] to heal the [[paralysis]] and just running and shooting [[Bolt]]s combined with [[exori san]], although it is recommended to use a decent [[Shields|shield]] and [[Royal Spear]]s or [[Enchanted Spear]]s."
