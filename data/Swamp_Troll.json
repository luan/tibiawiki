After the 8.2 summer update they now drop [[Spear]]s as loot which makes them a good choice for low level [[Paladin]]s to hunt.\n\nAt least some Swamp Trolls around Venore worship the [[Football]] according to the book [[Holy Book of Swamptrolls (Book)|Holy Book of Swamptrolls]].",

This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed. More can be read in the news article \"{{OfficialNewsArchive|1894|Content Fixes}}\".\n\n==== Loot Change 2 ====\nAfter [[Updates/9.8]] they drop [[Mouldy Cheese]], because this item is required for a task in the [[Goblin Merchant Quest]] and should be easily available to low leveled players. This was suggested by a player on the test server forum.",
