    "bestiarytext": "Zarganashs hostile environment gave birth to an own breed of phantom that differs by the hazards that help to form them from the tormented souls they once were. The infernal phantom absorbed that much demonic energy that there is little to distinguish them from demons at all. With demonic incursion in Zarganash the amount to demonic residue has increased dramatically and what was once a rare occurrence is now a common sight in certain areas. Though their form follows that of other phantoms for all other regards they are more a demon than ghost. Yet as anything, Zarganash got a hold of, they can never break free from the realm and are trapped not only in the depths of the nether realms but also in their accursed state of ghostly denizens of Zarganash. Some described them as demonic entities trapped in ghostly bodies but in the end it's only a twisted mimicry that drives them. Ironically their emulation of demonic cruelty and behaviour doesn't differentiate them much from other phantoms at all. The key difference towards demons is that they lack any allegiance to the demonic hoards and the essence that fuels them is something entirely different. In combat their comparatively high intelligence and awareness is set off by their hatred and anger. Though in theory they are some of the more stable and intelligent phantom breeds, there is little chance for any meaningful conversation. Even if outnumbered and cornered, the infernal phantom will still attack suicidal instead of participating in negotiation. It is said though that stealthy observers witnessed gatherings of infernal phantoms in which they conversed with hushed voices in conspiratorial manner. If this hints to any greater plan or agenda of these phantoms or if it's just another mimicry of the demons is yet unknown.",
