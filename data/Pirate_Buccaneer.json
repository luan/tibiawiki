He displays an enormous arrogance and loves to bully his underlings. Some Pirate Buccaneers have already gained some fame and they do not feel good at all to stand in the shadow of their captains. They also fear to be outshone by other buccaneers. Usually not loved but feared by their crew members, they often duel each other and always look for an opportunity to exploit any weakness that their captain might show. By getting a good share of the plunder, their equipment is quite good and they usually wield some decent weapons and a good armor. Their daring and skilful manoeuvres impress friend and foe  alike.",
