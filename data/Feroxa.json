In this phase she is immune to almost everything except for [[Silvered Trap]]s and [[Life Drain]] damage. When [[Feroxa (Werewolf)|Feroxa]] walks on these traps, she will be damaged for 1,000 health points and the traps will vanish. The traps can be stacked and she does not heal, so it's a matter of having enough traps to bring the boss to half health. As an alternative, sorcerers and druids can summon either [[Gozzler]]s or [[Ghoul]]s to deal [[Life Drain]] damage, but this process takes a lot longer.\n\nAt half health, she will change into [[Feroxa (Killable Werewolf)|her killable werewolf form]]. Now you must attack her with all your firepower.\n\nWhen she reaches 0 health she will either turn into her weak human form or [[Feroxa (Gloom Wolf)|her gloom wolf form]], both of which are quite weak and must be taken down with sheer firepower.\n\nYou will receive two sets of loot for the whole battle. Only the final form of Feroxa (Gloom Wolf) will grant you a kill count in the [[Bosstiary]].",
