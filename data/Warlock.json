They use [[invisibility]] very frequently and keep their distance, so it's hard to tell where they are.<br />\n'''[[Knight]]s''' should attack them as soon as possible with a two handed weapon since they are weak in [[Melee]] and defense. Make sure you trap them in a corner, they can be a real pain when they are running around everywhere. When blocking Warlocks it is normally more efficient to use full offense rather than full defense. Running in their direction and using [[Groundshaker]] is a good way to make them visible again, you can also use [[Whirlwind Throw]] shortly after they go invisible and they will be visible again, another way to make them visible is casting [[Inflict Wound]].<br />\n'''[[Paladin]]s''', '''[[Druid]]s''' and '''[[Sorcerer]]s''' should have a blocker. [[Druid]]s and [[Sorcerer]]s should attack them with [[SD]]s or [[Explosion]]. High leveled mages should trap them in a corner and use [[Exori Mort]] or [[Exori moe ico]] to kill them, and occasionally [[Exura Gran]]. A skilled [[Paladin]] could solo a warlock by trapping it in a corner and attacking with [[Assassin Star]]s while using [[Divine Missile]] or runes to break their invisibility, alternatively [[Divine Caldera]] if the warlock isn't trapped.<br />\n'''For all vocations''' it is recommended to carry [[Stone Shower]] runes '''ONLY''' to break warlocks' invisibility, as it won't deal any good damage even if your [[Level]] is high, another way to break [[Invisibility]] is by casting damage over time spells depending on Vocation: [[Envenom]] (ED), [[Curse]] (MS), [[Inflict Wound]] (EK) or [[Holy Flash]] (RP). Note that Envenom, Curse and Inflict Wound will produce damage every 4 seconds, while Holy Flash every 10 to 12  seconds, and due to Warlocks high resistance against Earth damage, Envenom could only cause damage for way less turns than Curse or Inflict Wound, so it is advisable for paladins and druids to use runes or area spells instead."
