    "bestiarytext": "Werepanthers are humans under a curse - others claim infected with a disease - that causes them to transform into savage beasts. At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.\nWerepanthers are quick and agile, but not as tough and strong as the weretigers. They are cunning predators and their appearance is a mix between a panther and a human being. Like panthers, Werepanthers favour warm jungles as their homesteads and are smart and adaptable. It is believed that werepanthers whose fur has a bluish hue are even more cunning than their black-furred counterparts.",
