    "bestiarytext": "Werewolves are humans under a curse that causes them to lose control over their inner beasts.  At the beginning, the transformation takes only place at full moon and the victim retransforms to its human appearance at the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation starts more and more early and lasts for a longer time. At a certain point, the beast takes over and there is no return. The human part is washed away by rage and primal instincts. The cursed person has turned into a savage Werewolf permanently.<br />Werewolves are ferocious beasts who enjoy the thrill of a hunt. They are unnatural born hunters that have many traits of a wolf, but much more dangerous and lethal. Like wolves, a Werewolf claims a large hunting ground as its own and everything alive is seen as a suitable prey. Unlike wolves, werewolves do not only hunt for food, but also for the thrill of the hunt itself. Their magical nature makes them extremely resistant and their regeneration powers are legendary.<br />The curse of the Werewolf is usually spread by the infectious bite of other werewolves. Forbidden books tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a Werewolf with the help of dark rites. Some rotten individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope to use their new powers in order to take revenge for some injustice or insult.",

It will eventually enter the field to attack the shooter, but the summoned War Wolves and other Werewolves will stay out of it.<br>\nKnights hunting solo are advised to take advantage of the environment as much as possible in order to prevent their shielding from being broken."
