    "bestiarytext": "Gladiators are professional warriors. Some of them are desperate or unscrupulous beings that  willingly joined the ranks of the Gladiators, however, most Gladiators were forced into service by masters who had some sort of power over them. Already the training of the Gladiators is cruel and lethal and causes many dead bodies.<br />In the past, the Gladiator profession seems to have been more noble than today and people came mainly to watch  the impressive fighting skills. Nowadays, however, Gladiator fights are brutal and bloody battles which mostly end deadly. Only a few arenas have specialised in harmless fights which end after the first blood was spilled. Several cities have banned arena fights as they are too dangerous.<br />When the games in Yalahar had become more and more cruel in order to distract the masses from other problems, more and more Gladiators were replaced with criminals and mercenaries of various races. At some point, the Gladiators rebelled and tried to take over the city. Even though the revolt failed in the end, the arena quarter was lost to the revolting forces. The Gladiators could not maintain some sort of leadership, though, and their community quickly splintered into several subgroups. Today, the Yalaharian Gladiators are often descendants of these rebels. The title Gladiator became rather a name than a profession. Also the new generations of Gladiators are trained  like their forefathers. They take part in brutal arena fights in which opposing families want to prove their superiority over each other.<br />Most Gladiators who are encountered in more uncivilised areas are quite likely to attack just to make a point. Gladiators are foes with deadly skills and much battle experience that often gives them an advantage in a fight. Gladiators hardly care if they attack weaker or stronger opponents. They consider both as good possibilities to train their skills.",
