However, people tell that some of them prove extremely resistant to all the poisons they devour in their life. They seem to be immortal and therefore, grow stronger and bigger than the rest of their kind, reaching even the size of an ox or a small barn.<br />Perhaps these stories hold a grain of truth because now and then really huge rotworms are spotted amongst their kind. These so-called Carrion Worms seem to be no species of their own but indeed just older, bigger and meaner rotworms. Their capabilities seem to exceed the ones of the smaller rotworms in all means although they seem to have no special position in the mindless society of worms. Carrion Worms are usually accompanied by a host of smaller worms which makes them even more dangerous. They have some sort of tusks that can easily penetrate a good armor. In fights they are protected by a hide which has grown pretty thick during many decades.",
