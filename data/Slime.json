A good tactic is to mark the slime that summons the others as only the original will do this. When a slime summons, you will see the blue shimmer of a spell being cast. Watch out, they can kill low levels very fast if they get trapped, especially mages. If you ever get trapped by 3 or more, try to kill the \"motherslime\", i.e the one summoning other slimes.",

Try to attack them in narrow passages where only two slimes can attack you (they have strong attacks and three or more will break your shielding).\n*'''[[Paladin]]s:''' Just attack them and don't get cornered. Try not to lose the real slime so you don't waste [[ammunition]].\n*'''[[Mage]]s''' should use a [[rod]] or [[wand]] to attack these creatures. Keep in mind that they are immune to [[earth]], so [[Snakebite Rod]]s, [[Terra Rod]]s and [[Springsprout Rod]]s are useless. Take care not to get cornered and avoid being attacked by more than two slimes at the same time. If you get surrounded and lose a lot of [[hitpoints]], [[Great Fireball Rune]]s might be useful."
