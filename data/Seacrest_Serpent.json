They only tolerate some of their smaller brethren and critters like jellyfish or sharks who live off their waste and pick their teeth clean for them.<br />Not unlike dragons, seacrest serpents love things that glitter, and preferably build a nest in sunken ships or amidst a hoard of gold, in which to hatch their young. Sailors surmise that in the mating season, these giant serpents take down fully laden ships on purpose in order to attract a partner.",

A combination of [[Koshei's Ancient Amulet]], [[Moon Mirror]], [[Butterfly Ring]] and maybe a [[Skullcracker Armor]]/[[Yalahari Armor]] can be used to reduce incoming damage from them. Avoid fighting more than two at time because their damage really adds up, specially if accompanied by [[Sea Serpent]]s. Standing diagonal may be useful as well."
