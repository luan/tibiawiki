    "bestiarytext": "A mass of living unlight, the Darklight Matter is a writhing entity pulsating with corrupted energy. It is an aberration, formed from the merging of darkness and light in the fallen realm. Dark tendrils writhe and coil within its form, as if reaching out to snuff out any remaining traces of illumination. The Darklight Matter emanates an aura of suppressed power, drawing in the surrounding shadows and distorting the fabric of reality. Its mere presence causes disturbances in the natural flow of energy, leaving a trail of darkness and corruption wherever it ventures. To encounter the Darklight Matter is to confront a living paradox, an entity birthed from the very essence of the fallen realm.",
