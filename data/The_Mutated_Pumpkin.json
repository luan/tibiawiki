The possible rewards for defeating it were [[Spiderwebs]], [[Pumpkin]], [[Candy Cane]]s, [[Surprise Bag (Red)]], [[Bat Decoration]], [[Bar of Chocolate]], [[Skeleton Decoration]], [[Pumpkinhead]] or [[Yummy Gummy Worm]]s.\n\nSince 2009, its body couldn't be moved or walked over as to receive the rewards, one had to use an [[Obsidian Knife]]. After using the knife, players would be teleported to [[Darashia]] [[Depot]] to prevent blocking the rewards for others. Also, [[Toy Spider]] and [[Surprise Bag (Blue)]] where added to the rewards. \n\nIn 2013 its loot was changed to the [[Cooperative Loot System]]; every participant since then receives 5 [[Pumpkin]]s and 10 [[Yummy Gummy Worm]]s, while the rare items are awarded to players with high participation points among the fighters.\n\nOn Halloween 2011, some more {{Thread|31430650|changes}} were made to The Mutated Pumpkin invasion. Only the last twenty players who dealt damage to it were able to receive a reward (this was fixed in 2012). 50 [[Candy|Candies]] were also added to the list of possible rewards.",
