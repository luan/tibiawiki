    "bestiarytext": "The Sopping Carcasses are unfortunate followers who seemingly had not the luck to die with their fallen god but were instead taken over alive by decay and rot, likely eons ago. Their desiccated bodies are trapped in a state of perpetual decay, perpetually soaked in a putrid sludge that oozes from their withering flesh. The scent of decay hangs heavy in the air around them, a nauseating reminder of their eternal torment. These wretched beings shuffle aimlessly through the fallen realm, their existence a testament to the relentless grip of decay and the insidious nature of the realm they inhabit. Despite their deteriorating forms, the Sopping Carcasses possess a twisted vitality, fueled by the foul energies that course through their veins. They lash out with clumsy yet potent attacks, driven by an instinctual desire to spread the corruption that has consumed them.",
