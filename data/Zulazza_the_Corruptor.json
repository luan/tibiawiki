Even if you have a lot of health, this monster can deal a great amount of damage. That combined with his poison bomb can kill you without even noticing it. It poisons you from 20 - 30hp per turn.\nWhen you are about to get low on health, just go down the stairs and quickly regenerate. Watch out for any [[Draken Warmaster]] and [[Draken Spellweaver]] respawns.\nIf you are with not so many [[player]]s, try to let one [[knight]] run through the chamber while others shoot because this [[boss]] is not fast at all, however, if it [[retarget]]s, it could be disastrous.",
