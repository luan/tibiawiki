Others who lost their herds to famines or raids of the henchmen of the Pharaoh have turned to banditry. Be that as it may, these few Nomads have become a serious threat to the unwary traveller. They are not enough to form a raiding party of some size, but small groups of Nomad bandits can be encountered almost everywhere in the desert nowadays.",
