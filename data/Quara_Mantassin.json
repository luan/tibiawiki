Like all quara, they have undergone massive modifications of their bodies which have made them an own subspecies. Especially in their native, maritime habitat, they are masters of camouflage and disguise. However, also on land they are known for stealthy sneak attacks. But away from their natural element, the water, they are weaker and easier to defeat.<br />Usually they serve their race in special operations and they are the ones that target the leaders of their enemies in big battles. With an arsenal of tricks the Quara Mantassin are quite capable on their own. Their love for covert operations gives them their place in the quaran warfare but they are not seen too often in open battles. On the other hand, a Quara Mantassin that you do not see is four times deadlier than a Quara Mantassin that you do see.",

When it turns invisible use [[Groundshaker]], [[Whirlwind Throw]], or [[Thunderstorm]] to get it visible again or just wait because the invisibility lasts for a short amount of time unless it casts it again.<br>'''Mages''': should use energy based attacks. If it runs away in deep red, shoot it with [[Heavy Magic Missile]] or area runes. It's safe to fight two at once, provided you're ready to cast a [[Healing Spells|healing spell]].<br>'''Paladins''': should use shield and a throwing weapon as Mantassins are very fast and if you use crossbow or bow it could cause you significant damage."
