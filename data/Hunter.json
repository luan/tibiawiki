A good strategy for knights would be to run towards them in full defense and once you are near them, attack with full offense. Another strategy is to duck behind a corner of a house and force the hunter to walk closer to you. Because of the hunter's low defense a knight can kill them easily.<br />\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' should not fight these creatures unless they have a [[Stealth Ring]], shield or high enough skills to kill them in 1 or 2 shots, and if you're planning to kill it without spells or runes, make sure to have a good [[healing]] [[spell]], [[rune]] or [[potions|potion]] ready in case of a high hit. A distance level of around 50 is recommended to kill them easily.<br />\n'''[[Mage]]s''' should use [[Invisible]] or if they are hunting them they should summon [[monk]]s. Overall, stay away from these unless you have to get through them to get to where you want to hunt (e.g. [[Hero]]es) or if you need to get a pair of [[Sniper Gloves]]. They usually aren't worth the trouble."
