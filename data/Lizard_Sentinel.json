Bred and raised for this purpose, only the Lizard Sentinels seem to have an almost steady supply for their troops whose strength lies in their numbers. They are rather distance than melee fighters and they try to shun close combat which seems to be a privilege of the Templars. If Lizard Sentinels are forced to fight eye to eye, they defend themselves almost reluctantly as if they were even in the face of death trying to avoid breaking any taboo.",
