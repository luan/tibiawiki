You can consider this boss as a stronger [[Efreet]] with a lot of hitpoints. Any vocation should kill him quickly before his summons increase total damage. \n\n'''[[Paladin]]s''' should run and use [[Assassin Star]]s. \n\n'''[[Mages]]''' should simply attack him with SD's and/or [[Ice Strike]].<br>\n\n'''[[Knights]]:''' Since moving is not necessary while fighting him, you bring a strong two handed weapon and wear a [[Sword Ring|Sword]], [[Axe Ring|Axe]], or [[Club Ring]] while fighting him and wear your [[Dwarven Ring]] later. Also, bring along some mana potions to attack him with [[berserk]], heal if your hp gets below 500, and 800 if he has both summons.",
