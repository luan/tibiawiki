Due to their walkspeed of 870 a distance weapon or area runes are best. [[Invisible]] is very helpful as they won't run away. Kill them and return the stolen presents to [[Ruprecht]] in [[Vega]] for a reward. They do spawn in some areas not immediately obvious to all players (such as the edges of cities). Low levels may want to head for these areas first as there is less competition.\n\nFor those interested in farming as many [[Snowman Package]]s as possible, using a [[Prey System|Loot Prey]] can be very useful. Note that [[Grynch Clan Goblin]]s can only be selected by using 5 Wildcards and won't appear on the random daily list roll."
