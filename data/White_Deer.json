    "bestiarytext": "The majestic White Deer were once thought to be an elven myth. Even the elves, who once were familiar with the beasts, could not recall a time when one of them had been sighted. Therefore the reappearance of the White Deer has been considered a good omen by the elvish society. In recent years under the protection of the elves, the population of the White Deer has recovered to a healthy base. Still the population is somewhat fragile and several local carnivorous animals, most prominently the wolves, have become dependent of the White Deer as prey. So despite elvish efforts, the deer are still endangered. Should too many of them meet an early demise, the population would have a hard time to recover, given all the predators of the woods.<br />The White Deer itself is a magnificent yet peaceful creature of grace and beauty. Its fur and antlers are valued by traders though it is somewhat difficult to find a trader that does not fear the elvish ire. In modern days, the deer has been mostly demystified. The assumption of great wisdom has been discarded and the myths about its magical abilities have been disproved. Neither can the deer change the weather nor can they turn invisible when in danger. The human view of 'just another type deer' has led to confrontations with elvish rangers who vigorously defend the deer from hunters. So despite the profitable loot, the hunting of White Deer has become the domain of a few unscrupulous or daring individuals that do not mind to clash with self-proclaimed elvish protectors.",
