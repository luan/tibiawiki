Nevertheless, people are still looking for her to this very day. \n\nIf you have ever encountered [[Hero]]es, you may have noticed that they asked you if you have seen her by any chance. \n\n[[Minishabaal]] claims not only to have seen Princess Lumelia, he even says he had her for breakfast. \n\nIn the [[The Cave]], [[A Bearded Woman]] is being held captive by [[Pirates]] precisely because of his excellent impersonation of Princess Lumelia.",
