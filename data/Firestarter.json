When the elves realised what had happened, the temple was already fully ascended. Within a week after the event, most of the elves started to worship the forgotten god. But not all fell for this influence. A selected few rose against these blinded followers. When the elder god of the bog told the elves of Shadowthorn to capture all rioters, these insurgents started to sow what the lord of the bog hates most - fire. During the very short time this conflict lasted, both parties were about equal in both, strength and fanatism. In the end, the elf followers won the upper hand by an eyelash. The Firestartes were imprisoned in the dungeons beneath Shadowthorn. They are heavily guarded because the elves fear the Firestarters' wrath and the havoc they will surely wreak if ever released.",
