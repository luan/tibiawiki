Guards have a somewhat unique retargeting behavior in that they do not move around players in the way to their target, but they do not immediately attack the obstructing player either. In this way, they will stand by the obstructing player and continue to throw spears at their target - and nobody will receive melee damage. The only ways to force a guard to attack you are by the use of [[Challenge]] or by having the target leave the guard's sight.",

    "strategy": "Treat them as you would treat a [[behemoth]]; although they have less health, their attacks strongly resemble those of a [[behemoth]]. Try to single them out and avoid third-hitting Deepling guards. Beware that they come with [[Deepling Spellsinger]]s which drain your mana and reduce your skills immensely; focus on the spellsingers before the guards (especially for knights and paladins). Mages and paladins should try to keep a distance from the guard but avoid running in uncleared areas, as they come in large groups with other Deeplings. Don't let it run as it has strong healing capabilities.<br />In group hunts, shooters should be wary of a Deepling guard's retargeting behavior and expect to heal often as their spears can cause considerable damage."
