Her change in tactics and the more covert approach has led to the hiring of shady characters to reinforce the order. Any Cobra Vizier is a dangerous foe but in combination with other viziers, they become an unstoppable force of magic. They act as the real guard of the order and defend Scarlett and the other Cobras with an intricate web of spells. Their dark magic is arcane and twisted, to oppose them is to challenge mighty, long lost arts. Born in the shadows and nurtured by death.",
