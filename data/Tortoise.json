It is disputed whether the Tortoise has learnt at last to defend itself or, as some members of the explorer's society claim, some kind of natural selection has set in that left only the meanest and most aggressive Tortoises. Be that as it may, nowadays the island Tortoises are quite capable to defend themselves. Heavy natural armor and a strong jaw make up for their slowness to some extent. Still their slowness is their major weakness and it is probably only a matter of time until humans rout them out in their last refuges on the isles.",

It no longer hits as hard as it used to, but some testing suggests that it \"trains\" like a slime would. They have abnormally high hit points, and heal a lot, very quickly. This monster is designed to make [[Cheating|Cheaters]] \"stuck\" on this monster, since they cannot kill it."
