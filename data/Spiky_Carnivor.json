They are coveted materials for craftsmanship.<br />\nDuring their development, they go through various stages which ultimately manifest in specific habits and appearance.<br /><br />\nThe adolescent carnivor has already breeded a massive protective dorsum. So its name is spiky carnivor. Not only the appearence changes at that age but also the way of hunting. This species attacks its opponents mainly from distance, using its spikes as fatal projectiles. For hunters that prefer close combat it is a challenge to drive them into a corner. Distance fighters won't have that problem.",
