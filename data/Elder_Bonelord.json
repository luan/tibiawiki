Just like the size of this creature has enlarged also its evilness and power has done. Its magic outshines that of an ordinary bonelord and its mastery of the necromantic arts has reached levels that had so far been unknown to bonelords. It is them who spawn the dreaded gazers that grow into new bonelords and ensure the existence of the race. It is them who lead the other species of their kind with an iron will and brutal suppression. And it is them who have accumulated knowledge about magic and especially necromancy that was never meant to be known by any creature, dead or alive.",

You should watch out for [[Demon Skeleton]]s, which are '''not''' summoned and will deal quite a lot of damage if you are unprepared.<br>\nIf you encounter them when you don't intend to hunt or pass through them, for example while completing [[The Paradox Tower Quest]], it is best to use [[Sudden Death]] or [[Explosion]] runes; two or three hits should kill them quickly, and they will pose little trouble.<br>\nIt is often advantageous to wear an [[Elven Amulet]] when fighting Elder Bonelords, as this will reduce all damage by 5%."
