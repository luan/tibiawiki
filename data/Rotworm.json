    "strategy": "If you cannot kill them fast or withstand attacks from several rotworms at once, never let yourself get trapped in a corner, as you cannot [[push]] rotworms. Really easy to hunt for all [[Vocation]]s.\n[[Druid]]s and [[Sorcerer]]s can hunt them easily with [[Snakebite Rod]] or [[Wand Of Vortex]] because these use very little [[Mana]] and rotworms drop [[food]] so you can constantly regenerate.<br>[[Knight]]s and [[Paladin]]s can hunt them with no great trouble even at 30/30, but low-leveled characters (for example players at level 8 who can't use [[Exura]] or [[Exura Ico]] yet) should be careful not to get trapped, as rotworms are not pushable. These vocations also often use rotworms for training, but they may quickly become insufficient because of their weak [[defense]].<br>If you are in [[Rookgaard]], do not hunt them alone without good equipment like [[Chain Armor]], [[Legion Helmet]] and a [[Copper Shield]]. It also helps to bring [[parcel]]s (or [[box]]es, while in [[Rookgaard]]) with you, since then you can take only one or two at a time by blocking them with objects.. Using [[Bow]] or [[Spear]]s instead of melee is also a good strategy."
