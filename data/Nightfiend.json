They arrived in Drefia in the wake of the vampire nobles, and they seem to be the fiercer cousins of the manbats, but darker, stronger and even more vicious. <br />Some surmise that the nightfiend might be the result of strange experiments with vicious manbats in Drefia, where both species have first been sighted. Some speculate that they are a sort of bodyguard or pet for the vampire nobles that reside there, but considering the nightfiends' strength, the latter seems unlikely. <br />In any case, nightfiends are fierce fighters that will be aided by manbats if attacked. The first man to see a nightfiend was the only survivor of a large exploration party searching for a lost artefact, and barely made it out in one piece.",
