Although, if you have another character with the best [[Rook Set|rookie equipment]], lots of [[Small Health Potion|potions]] and a [[Star Ring]] and put it in a bag on the bridge to give it to your character that is about to meet the demon, you may have a chance of killing him. Note that you have to train on [[Deer]]. In march 2012 a team of 19 guys in Chimera tried to kill him, but the whole team failed without damaging him. The room with Kraknaknork's Demon has no way out so you can either die, or 4 friends can teleport you if you log out in the corner (that will bring you to temple). It is also possible to wait for a major update to automatically bring your character to the temple.",
