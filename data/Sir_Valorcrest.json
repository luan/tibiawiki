It's best to make them run away, as they won't respawn and you can focus on fighting Sir Valorcrest, just keep using [[Great Health Potion]]s as often as you can, whether you need them or not, as a strong combo can give you a free trip to the [[Temple]]. If your [[health]] goes below 200 it's recommended to go upstairs to heal and then go back.<br/>\n'''Mages''' should have a blocker and shoot with fire spells, but other elements work too.<br/>\n'''[[Paladin]]s''': Same strategy as mage, blocker and shoot with [[bolts]]/[[Enchanted Spear]]s while using [[Divine Missile]]. <br/>\nHigher [[Level]] [[Knight]] can block it (100+) while a [[Paladin]]/[[Mage]] quickly kill it.",
