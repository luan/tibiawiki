He, his brothers [[Arthei]], [[Marziel]], and [[Boreth]], and Arthei's wife [[Kala]], travelled to [[Yalahar]] in order to find a new home. From that moment on Marziel started keeping a [[Arthei's Descent into Vampirism I (Book)|diary]].<br>Lersatio is a vain vampire who dreams to see his face in a mirror again, which is why he awakens when you break the mirrors near him. He is the second boss you will encounter during the [[Blood Brothers Quest]]. He spawns with 2 [[Vampire]]s.<br>You will receive [[The Dust of Lersatio]] when you use a [[Blessed Wooden Stake]] on his dead body.",
