This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

The Dworc Vodoomasters are known and feared for their curses and their ability to use sinister magic that drains their victim's life and mana. Being cowardly and sneaky, they prefer to accompany other dworcs on their attacks rather than to face enemies on their own. Fighting in the second line, they pose a serious threat by using spells that allow their allies to defeat even much stronger enemies. Since the Dworc Voodoomasters are able to cover their retreat with curses and spells, it is hard to get hold of them. Lacking the ability to launch any threatening attack on their own, they fall quickly if they are actually caught alone.",

    "strategy": "[[Knight]]s: It would be wise to carry mana potions and plenty of food since you will be using exura to get rid of the paralyze and dworcs don't drop food. Close in fast and take them down. Alternatively, use [[Whirlwind Throw]]. [[Stealth Ring]]s may be cheaper than runes if you want to avoid them being constantly invisible, as long as you use the ring only for a few seconds for each Voodoomaster.<br>\n[[Mage]]s: Use [[GFB]] or [[Avalanche (Rune)|Avalanche Runes]] when there are many and attack with your [[wand]] or [[rod]], alternatively you can [[summon]] [[Monk]]s or [[Tarantula]]s. This way the hunt will cost much less and you can make runes and have enough mana to heal when needed.<br>\n[[Paladin]]s: Should use any good ranged weapon to kill them without need to move, that way you wouldn't get hit by the poison storm and you would need a [[Dwarven Ring]] less, if you use a short range weapon you will have to run to them, so bringing a Dwarven Ring and extra health potions would be useful."
