Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient. Dark carnisylvans are tainted by corrupted magic and try to enchant their victims with bizarre spells. It is not easy to escape the clutches of a dark carnisylvan as most of its spells are also instantly affecting the mind.",
