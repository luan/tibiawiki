These twisted entities pulse with an unholy radiance, emanating waves of corrupted energy that cast sinister shadows on their surroundings. Some speculate that they are connected to the constructs in an abominable symbiotic relationship, serving as catalysts for the darklight's corruptive powers. The Darklight Emitters stand as beacons of malevolence, their presence instilling a profound sense of unease and foreboding in those unfortunate enough to encounter them.",
