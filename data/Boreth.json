He, his brothers [[Arthei]], [[Marziel]], and [[Lersatio]], and Arthei's wife [[Kala]], travelled to [[Yalahar]] in order to find a new home. From that moment on Marziel started keeping a [[Arthei's Descent into Vampirism I (Book)|diary]].<br>Boreth is a plant-crazy vampire. You can see it by the lots of plants that grow in his tower. He is the first boss you will encounter during the [[Blood Brothers Quest]]. You can summon him by thrice using a [[Firebug]] on the [[Twines]] in front of his throne. There are 2 [[Plaguethrower]]s in his room.<br />You will receive [[The Dust of Boreth]] when you use a [[Blessed Wooden Stake]] on his dead body.",
