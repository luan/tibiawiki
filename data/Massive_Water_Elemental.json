They usually live in the deep seas and it was never heard that they have ever left the sea at all. It is speculated that they draw a significant portion of their power from the surrounding sea and that they might turn into normal water elementals if they ever left the sea for a longer period. Massive Water Elementals are extremely powerful and can stand a considerable amount of damage. Using their liquid form, they can pass each terrain with ease and they usually try to get their prey as fast as they can, crushing it with their tremendous strength. Having immense magical powers, no one within sight can escape their ferocious attacks.<br />Sometimes Massive Water Elementals seem to ally with energy elementals, particularly if a storm is approaching. It is unknown whether such alliances are formed by chance or if they are planned. Be that as it may, it is surely one of the worst nightmares that one can experience when two types of elementals attack a ship or a seaport while a violent storm is raging.",
