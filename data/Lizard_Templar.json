Part of this code seems to be fighting valiantly the warm-blooded races which they regard as intruders in their realm. Their thick scale skin, their incredible toughness and their unwavering determination to win a fight had made the lizard people the dominating race in Tiquanda for a long time. Even their enemies must credit them skilfulness and elegance in the usage of their exotic weapons. Probably, lizards see a fight as a religious experience. Their fighting style is obviously very formalised yet very efficient. The snake-like blade-dance that they perform in combat is only clouded by their overconfidence and their inability to accept defeat.",
