    "notes": "When you look at a summoned Sorcerer Familiar, you will see the summoner's character name and how long it will take for the summon to disappear.â€‹ It can be summoned by [[Sorcerer]]s of level 200 or higher, by saying the magic words:''Utevo gran res ven'' [[Summon Sorcerer Familiar]]. All the experience that is expected to be 'gained' by the summon goes to the player. So there is no shared exp between the summon and its summoner, like with the normal [[Summon Creature]] spell.\n\nIt will follow players at their speed and will go up and down stairs and holes with them. It lasts for 15 minutes with a 30 minutes cooldown. It can go with you to a protection zone. If you logout, it will disappear stopping the countdown of its timer, and will reappear when you login again.",

    "strategy": "The Sorcerer Familiar can be very useful for low level Sorcerers as a free blocker and damage boost. Due to its timer/cooldown mechanic, you cannot have 100% uptime of it, so it's important to beware when it's about to disappear as all creatures will change target. Since it's main function is to act like a blocker, it's not recommended to use it when hunting with a Knight as it will Challenge the creatures away from him, reducing the knight's damage output. \n\nLearning how to manage the summon can be tricky at first, as you cannot force it to cast its challenge spell. You should be prepared to block the creatures you're going to fight for a few turns until the Sorcerer Familiar challenges them, since its spell use is quite erratic. Similarly, it's possible that it doesn't use the spell for a few seconds, allowing the creatures to retarget. An important strategy when using the Sorcerer Familiar to block several creatures is to always change your target to the creature that will die last, because if the Sorcerer Familiar doesn't have a target it will run back to its master, bringing the creatures its blocking with it. \n\nAt higher levels, the Sorcerer Familiar is used mostly in emergencies to Challenge creatures that are trapping another player or yourself. This however isn't always effective as the summon dies very quickly to strong creatures and may not even use the Challenge spell before that.",
