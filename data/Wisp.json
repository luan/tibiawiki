Without noticing, their light often lures unsuspecting wanderers into the bog who mistake them for the lights of a nearby village. Wisps are rather timid and try to flee whenever a human is in sight. While trying to escape, they lure those unlucky souls deeper and deeper into the bog. In the treacherous swamps, such encounters can even end deadly.<br />The light of Wisps is blinding and confusing if you look at it directly. They are quite fast, but whoever gets too close will experience that a Wisp's touch drains the life force from all living creatures. However, as they will always try to escape, they only pose a small threat to humans.",
