They are quite intelligent and seem to be, together with the quara hydromancer, the leaders of this sinister race. Their tentacles make them dangerous foes. They allow the Quara Constrictor to attack more than one target at once and to grapple or strangle their helpless prey. Using the same abilities like electric eels, they are also able to stun their enemies for a short time. To stand a better chance to defeat them, you should try to fight them on land where they are somewhat weaker than swimming in water.<br />Only few of them exist and since they are somewhat cowardly by nature, you don't meet them too often in combat. If forced to fight, they are quite capable to defend themselves. They often surprise their enemies with dirty tricks and an iron resolve. This subspecies seems to be somehow responsible for modifying and altering the other quara. How exactly this is done and to which extent the Quara Constrictor is involved in these transformation processes is unknown.",
