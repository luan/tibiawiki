    "notes": "He's the boss of the [[Hunter]]s and [[Poachers]] in the [[Hunter Camp]], but also seems to be a researcher studying the culture of the [[Dworcs]]. While at first the man-eating Dworcs seemed rather passive towards them and everything was going as planned, things soon turned grim. After the young and inexperienced members of the group [[Jenkinson]] and [[Abrams]] first managed to be infected by a strange toxin, the Dworcs also suddenly turned on them. They ended up being gorily sacrificed and eaten before his eyes after dying a painful death from the poison. He wrote those experiences down in [[Dworc Misadventure (Book)|his notes]], and from these it actually appears that he eventually died himself too. Here he is, however, very much alive.\n\n<gallery>\nArthom the hunter.png\n</gallery>",
