Others take apprentices later to have compliant henchmen at their disposal. The Dark Apprentices are nothing than a shadow of their masters who greedily hide their secrets and only share small parts of their knowledge if there is no choice. Kept in line by the promise to gain forbidden knowledge and parts of their master's power, they are just as scrupulous as their masters. Sometimes a dark magician has several apprentices and enjoys their rivalry for his attention. This way, the Dark Apprentices usually focus their scheming minds on other apprentices instead on their master. Being constantly treated badly by their masters, they use every opportunity to demonstrate their own malice over other beings. Usually more ambitious than competent,  they are minor threats only. However, several apprentices that are trying to support and impress their master can still be fatal for badly prepared adventurers though.",
