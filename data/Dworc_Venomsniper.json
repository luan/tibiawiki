This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

It is disputable if this results in their weaker physical constitution or in the fact that they are simply smarter than the average dworcish male. They are the dworcs with the best knowledge and skills in brewing poison, and no Dworc Venomsniper has ever been encountered without carrying various vials filled with some toxin. Single snipers are a rare view. Usually, they hide behind the fleshhunters and hurl volleys of poisonous projectiles at their enemies from a safe distance. If they get cornered, they are easy prey since they lack the skill and weaponry to stand a serious assault on their own.",
