Use [[Challenge]] frequently if you are blocking as it [[retarget]]s often. Casting [[Inflict Wound]] early helps a lot. Cycle between using [[Brutal Strike]] and [[Whirlwind Throw]] to get the creature down as cheap as possible. Also watch out for other quaras that might break your shielding!\nNowadays Quara Predators are very easy to kill because of the introduction of energy imbuements and elemental melee weapons."
