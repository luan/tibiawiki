Be careful not to be surrounded as they have very high physical burst and 2 of them in melee range can easily kill a mage from full HP.\nIf you have to face many at at time, try to hit all of them with [[Terra Wave]]/[[Energy Wave]]. If you don't have have room to run, energy/poison bombs and walls can be used to protect yourself from hordes.\nSince they have relatively low HP, a [[Energy Wave|Energy]]/[[Terra Wave]] followed by [[Rage of the Skies]]/[[Wrath of Nature]] is usually enough to kill them in a pinch."
