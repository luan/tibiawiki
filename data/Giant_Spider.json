Just remember that a [[Crossbow]] has a range of 5, while enchanted spears only have a range of 4.

It is recommended to reach at least level 40-50 before trying this. [[Mage]]s should try their first solo at a single spawn (see above). At level 45+ you shouldn't need magic shield, unless there is more than one Giant Spider. If you need extra firepower you could summon [[Fire Devil]]s or [[Fire Elemental]]s."
