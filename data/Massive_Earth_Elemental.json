Though of course not nearly as big as a mountain, it is indeed towering and quite heavy. The sheer power of an elemental of such size is staggering,  and whoever had the misfortune to face a Massive Earth Elemental knows why people of the past used to call this creature like this. The Massive Earth Elemental is as mindless as its smaller brother, but represents the more powerful version. Even though reports of the destruction of whole settlements by Massive Earth Elementals suggests that these elementals aim for bigger targets than their smaller kin, it has recently been discovered that attacks on artificial structures by earth elementals happen just as often as by massive ones. Their fame as town destroyers only arose from  their strength which allows them to be much more successful than its smaller version.<br />It is unknown why earth elementals rise in different sizes. The followers of Crunor believe in a theory according to which this depends on the concentration of earth power in the mystic field.",
