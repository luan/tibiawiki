Get 1 more person with a high distance skill to shoot [[arrows]] or throw [[spears]] on offensive fighting. To solo the boss a fast player can run to the small north room to lure the boss inside. After that place two [[box]]es or [[Honey Flower|honey flower]]s to keep the [[minotaur]]s out and only fight Apprentice Sheng and 2 [[hyaena]]s (10-20 [[Small Health Potion|small health potions]] is best to keep yourself from dying). Another way is using [[Poison Arrow|poison arrows]] to lower defense, and [[spear]]s to kill the boss.\n\nStrategy for a single player: Stand in the oven room on the tile marked with white square on the screenshot, the Apprentice Sheng will keep the distance from you, but he will keep coming back to the tile marked with red square on the screenshot. Each time he comes back, you will hit him. At the same time you will only be attacked by a maximum of two other monsters, standing to your right. Apprentice Sheng will push one of the monsters away each time he walks onto the tile marked red. \n\n[[File:Apprentice Sheng Killing Method.png|200px|thumb|left]]",
