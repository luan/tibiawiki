All cyclops, with the exception of the simple-minded drones, are constantly trying to enhance their smithing skill. It's the aim of all cyclops to be recognised by their society as master smith. Of course being the cream of the crop is not achieved easily, and the cyclops never grant this prestigious title thoughtlessly.",

A good idea is to come with a paladin level 25+ and with a dwarven ring.<br />\n'''[[Knights]]:''' can kill them with skills 75/75 and at least level 35.
