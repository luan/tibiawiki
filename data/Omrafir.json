These heals are strengthened when he steps on a fire field as well as when he takes any fire damage ex:Great  fireball,flame strike,fireball rune, saying \"{{Sound|Omrafir gains new strength from the fire}}\". Omrafir casts a very strong fire beam a few seconds after saying \"{{Sound|OMRAFIR INHALES DEEPLY!}}\". When Omrafir drops to about 50% of health, the server will continuously check whether [[Flame of Omrafir]] have been killed or not. If any flames have been killed, Omrafir will despawn and 9 [[Hellfire Fighter]]s will appear all over the room. Once all Hellfire Fighters have been killed Omrafir respawns in the center of the room. However, this scenario will '''not''' happen more than '''three times'''. Omrafir uses the new [[Reward Chest|reward system]].",

If you managed not to kill a single flame he will fight until death without exploding.<br>\n'''Long:''' Once he is trapped attack him using the spells and runes you would like. This time you do not have to pay attention to his flames. Keep attacking him until he exploded a total of <u>three times</u> and then kill him as he will not explode a fourth time no matter if you kill his flames again or not.<br><br>\n'''NOTE:''' Apparently he always explodes in the last hit (one time at least).",
