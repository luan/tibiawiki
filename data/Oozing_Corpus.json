    "bestiarytext": "Among the fallen followers of the dead blood god, the Oozing Corpus represents a morbid manifestation of eternal decay. These abominations, even after eons, continue to ooze self-feeding decay, a testament to their cursed existence. Their bodies, once robust and filled with vitality, have been reduced to grotesque amalgamations of putrefaction and rot. Every movement is accompanied by a nauseating sludge, as if the very essence of decay seeps from their pores. The Oozing Corpuses, their minds fragmented and trapped in an eternal torment, mindlessly wander the fallen realm, perpetuating the cycle of decay as they leave a trail of foulness in their wake.",
