The poison condition inflicted by snakes does about 15 damage total which is something to watch out for for lower levels. They are also summoned by [[Orc Shaman]]s. Some players use the snakes summoned by [[Orc Shaman]]s for training. They [[Trap]] the [[Orc Shaman]] in a way he cannot shoot any magic missiles at them and then basically have an endless supply of constantly spawning snakes. [[Lizard Snakecharmer]]s drop [[Dead Snake]]s as loot.",

This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed. More can be read in the news article \"{{OfficialNewsArchive|1894|Content Fixes}}\".\n\n==== Resistances ====\nAs of [[Updates/9.8|update 9.8]], snakes are no longer immune to [[Earth Damage]]. This was changed per player suggestion because new [[Druid]]s cannot harm a snake with their [[Snakebite Rod]].",
