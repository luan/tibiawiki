They prefer to roam in caves and form small tribes and clans.The only notable difference to other trolls might be their habit to collect all sorts of things and to hoard them. This might come from the lack of resources on the isles or, as some suggest, from some religious background. Considering the disinterest in the topic trolls, no one bothered yet to investigate that further.",
