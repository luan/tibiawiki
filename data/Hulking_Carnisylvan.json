Some time after coming of age they wander away to fall into a neverending slumber deep underground. Standing in pitch-black darkness, sleeping still, dreaming quaint dreams of death they await the time of joint uprising. Some are born to be chosen custodians of their siblings, awake and sentient. Hulking carnisylvans have the strongest bark and endure an intangible amount of pain. Their attacks are devastating but they need to get close to their victims.",
