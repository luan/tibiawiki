While it is quite easy to raise a Zombie, it is more complicated to gain control. A good deal of aspiring zombie masters have died at the  rotting hands of a creature that was meant to become their minion.<br />Zombies have hardly any intelligence. If they do not have somebody controlling them, they tend to follow primal instincts such as eating and hunting. The undead state makes Zombies resilient and quite strong. However, their process of decomposing never stops and so sooner or later, a Zombie turns into a skeleton, losing strength and resilience, but strangely enough, gaining some intelligence.<br /><br />Sometimes the ingredients for zombiefication potions are set free in disadvantageous environments such as town wells through which the Zombie plague spreads like an infection. If this happens, whole towns are overrun by transformed Zombies that later haunt the surrounding area for months, or even years. For such incidents, all potential zombie masters are chased by the inquisition. In some years, the popularity to burn suspicious alchemists even outstripped the popularity of witch trials.",

[[Stealth Ring]]s may be useful to kill them when there are three or more.<br><br>\n'''Paladins:''' should keep distance and kill it like a [[Demon Skeleton]], however keep an eye on your mana as you may die if it drops too low. Bringing some health potions is recommended.<br><br>\n'''Mages:''' would have the worst time hunting, as they're immune to most elements and resistant to fire, if you do wish to hunt them it's a good idea to summon two demon skeletons, as they won't take much damage and let them do the work. You can add support them from the back using [[Explosion]] runes to speed the kill.<br><br>\nIt is recommended that you use your mana as often as you can because it will be wasted by mana drain."
