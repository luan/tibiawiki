If it comes to one-to-one battles, they can face even the strongest opponents due to their incredible armor and their sheer strength.",

    "strategy": "'''Knights''':You should bring some bps of Fire Fields, Just go down the hole and put Fire Fields beside you so only 1 creature can attack you at a time,  you can be there forever if you bring enough supplies and are skilled enough. You should bring some [[Mana potions]], they are cheap to heal with and you get some Magic Level % with them, Bringing health potions is advised too incase you get swarmed. Using a Fire Axe on this creature produces more damage than a royal axe and almost as much damage as a stonecutter axe due to this creatures high physical resistance and weakness to fire. Thornback Tortoises mostly attacks in groups with [[Tortoise]]s and [[Blood Crab]]s, so be careful when jumping down holes. Not very good to hunt for mages because they will use a lot of mana/runes to deplete its high hitpoints. '''Mages''' should use summons. Mages could bring alot of [[Great Fireball]] runes with them, and try to gather a big group of monsters and fire them down. You can easily gain 700-1500 exp like this."
