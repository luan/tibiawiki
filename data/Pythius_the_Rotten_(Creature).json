    "notes": "The '''Curse''' starts at 1 and normally stops after 34~ turns, but if he curses you again the 34 turns starts over from the damage it currently did. So the longer he keeps cursing you the higher the damage will get. The damage increases with 20% each turn. In the turn 34 it will look like this '''366''' then ''439''. Some people have died getting hits of 1400+ per turn. In the reward room make sure you heal or use mana shield if the damage is higher than your hp and wear any death protection equipments or you might die. [[Paladin]]s can simply use [[Cure Curse]] to remove it. '''Also''': On the floor under some trash there's a [[Guardian Shield]] a [[Spike Sword]] and a [[Knight Axe]]. If you have the skills you could pick them them up while killing Pythius.",

    "strategy": "'''Open PvP and Optional PvP worlds''': should use [[Fire Bomb]] or [[Fire Wall]] runes and run around it.<br />\n'''Mages:''' It's immune to energy and death. So even if it looks like an [[Undead Dragon|undead dragon]] don't bother with [[Energy Strike|exori vis]]. It seems that it doesn't have any resistance or weakness to ice, so your best bet could be [[Ice Strike|exori frigo]], [[icicle]] or [[avalanche]] (will help kill the summons as well). The room you face it in is large enough to run it. So just run it and watch your mana/hp. Another way you can do it is put a couple fire bombs or a fire wall and he will walk around it.<br />\n'''Knight:''' should use the 2 diagonal fire fields in the center, this will keep Pythius from moving and at the same time you will avoid the waves. Moreover, it is recommended to use a poison bomb at the corner, so that the summoned [[Undead Gladiator]] cannot attack you with melee. As a picture has done below. Level 110+ recomended, healing with 1000 HP using GHP. Like this: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8T4xa0qbWE Knight Level 113 killing Pythius the Rotten]<br />\n[[File:Firewalkerboots.PNG|thumb|Use Fire Field to keep Pythius the Rotten standing at diagonal spot.And use poison bomb to block summoned Undead Gladiator, so that it couldn't come to you.]]\n'''All Vocations:''' should kill it fast as you can. You need a [[Golden Mug]] to reach it. Also one great idea is for every vocation to use [[Might Ring|might ring]] or [[Death Ring|death ring]] even though it reduces your shielding by -10 it also reduces death damage so there is less chances of catching the curse and its death attacks will not as hurt you much.<br />\n[[Elven Amulet]] and [[Stone Skin Amulet]] are also great ideas. In the [[Treasure Rooms|treasure room]] it is recomended to use [[Koshei's Ancient Amulet]] or [[Death Ring]] or any other death protection equips to not die to curse.\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4EK99gRkWc&list=PLAO4znVdU3qR8BxHiXX9QMaHLqC2eTEQs&index=4  Level 139 EK (Rhysypie Too) killing Pythius the Rotten.]",
