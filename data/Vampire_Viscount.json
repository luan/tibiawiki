Masters of the rapier, they love to see their enemy bleed, heightening the pleasant anticipation of the kill while simultaneously letting their victim believe it could still win the fight. When hurt or when trying to impress his foe, the Viscount will eventually change form to scare his opponent away, and take on the shape of a vicious manbat.",
