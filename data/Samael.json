While Samael was bewildered right after entering our world, Eclesius managed to lock him up in a cage located under Eclesius' home. Keeping Samael's cage locked and in good shape is needed to \"prevent the apocalypse\", according to Eclesius who refers to him as a ''Demon Uberoverlord''.<br />\nIts name is confirmed by his fellow inmate [[A Confused Frog]] who describes Samael as an annoyed [[Demon Overlords|Demon Overlord]].<br />\nIt is not possible to see Samael from any known place in Tibia, however it is possible to hear his screams from {{Mapper Coords|text=outside his cellar|126.37|126.37|9|8|1|0.1250.125}}, from {{Mapper Coords|text=this cave in Thais sewers|126.48|126.4|9|8|1|0.1250.125}} and from {{Mapper Coords|text=Thais prison|126.71|126.18|9|8|1|0.1250.125}}.<br />\nAlthough some players believe it might be possible to reach and face Samael, there is no sustainable evidence that points the devs ever intended to make it possible for players to reach Samael.\n<gallery hideaddbutton=\"true\" position=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center\" captionalign=\"center\" spacing=\"small\" widths=\"190\" heights=\"190\" mode=\"nolines\">\nSamael's Cellar.png|Samael is located after the bars inside the locked cellar, one map field to the east of what can be seen in this image\nSamael's Team Finder.png|Samael can be seen in the [[Social#Team Finder|Team Finder]]'s boss list\n</gallery>",
