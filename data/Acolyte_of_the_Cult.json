They only respect higher ranks of the cult whom they obey like slaves their masters. Their magic is still fairly weak and does by far not match their ego. Having gained a glimpse at the work of the cult, it is not easy to sacrifice their curiosity and so they use their whole energy to strive for the higher ranks. Acolytes of the Cult are only involved in affairs if they are considered of importance for the cult.",
