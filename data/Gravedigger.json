The gravediggers are undead creatures that have first been sighted near the necromancer sites in Drefia, where they have at first been employed for strenuous handiworks such as digging and building up the underground ruins of Drefia. <br />Some speculate that the hands were chopped off live subjects and then enhanced through hideous rituals and processes to take their actual, ghastly form. However, the beasts proved to have a will of their own and soon broke free from their masters' grip, and some still roam the premises like other undead. They are solitary creatures and quite aggressive, but a few cases have been reported where humans made friends with a gravedigger, which lasted a lifetime.",
