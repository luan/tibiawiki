    "bestiarytext": "An unsettling sight to behold, the Meandering Mushroom is a fungoid mass driven by instinctive needs to devour and spread rot. Its existence is solely dedicated to the relentless pursuit of sustenance, causing everything it touches to wither and decay. With each step it takes, a sickly miasma emanates from its cap, suffusing the air with a putrid stench. Though lacking intelligence, its insatiable hunger propels it forward, leaving a trail of blighted landscapes and twisted flora in its wake. The Meandering Mushroom is drawn to sources of life, consuming them with a ravenous hunger, and ensuring that the realm's decay perpetuates unabated.",
