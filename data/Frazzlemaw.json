Another strategy would be to place an [[Energy Wall Rune|energy wall]] on the ground and make the '''Frazzlemaw''' run back and forth over it to deal extra damage. Higher level knights can simply attack and heal, although they can still throw in some spells to speed up the killing. <br>'''[[Paladin]]s:''' Avoid running too much because you will likely get swarmed. [[Assassin Star]]s are better than a bow or crossbow here because of their high melee. These monsters can be very profitable for paladins.<br> '''[[Druid]]s and [[Sorcerer]]s:''' Avoid soloing these monsters. They hit high and are hard to run from, as well as being resistant to most magic. They are also found in the presence of [[Silencer]]s, which will lower [[Magic Level]] and do strong [[Mana Drain]] attacks. Using a blocker to hunt these is the best idea."
