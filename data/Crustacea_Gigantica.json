Neither did it match any description of mythical creatures. All the more it is astonishing that considering their formerly unknown status sightings of Crustaceae Giganticae have become more and more common nowadays. These dwellers of the deep seem to leave their ancient habitats for unknown reasons and seek new areas to live in. Given the warlike nature of the Crustacea Gigantica it is somewhat unsettling to think what might have driven them away from their old realms. As of today, there are no valid theories about this occurrence, and although the quara are often mentioned as a possible cause, it seems more likely that the real cause is a new threat that lurks in the depths of the ocean.<br />The Crustacea Gigantica itself is not necessarily destructive but very territorial. When something enters their habitat, the simple-minded beasts distinguish only between food and robber. Both are to be eliminated by their powerful pincers. Their armoured shell serves for more than adequate defence in such cases.",
