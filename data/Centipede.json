This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

Being mainly a scavenger, the Centipede rarely hunts actively for prey; but if it runs into a creature, it will attack it nonetheless. Given the fact that it does not have to kill for a living, the Centipede is astonishingly tough and challenging in combat. Being fast and poisonous, the Centipede can be quite dangerous, and its fertility causes its appearance in large numbers. This creature seems ineradicable, several extermination campaigns have already failed. Wherever a carrion is laying, a Centipede is close. However, it prefers to live in caves and narrow tunnels. Mould and decay seem to attract it and not little made their homes in the sewers of the cities.",
