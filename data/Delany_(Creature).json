Players would obtain a [[Surprise Bag (Red)|Red Surprise Bag]] and 10 [[Cookie]]s, a [[Bottle]] of [[Milk]] '''OR''' a [[Party Hat]] by using his corpse. Some lucky players would get a [[Delany's Golden Bug Trophy]] instead of a [[Surprise Bag (Red)|Red Surprise Bag]].\n\nHe was immune to [[Physical Damage|Physical]] and [[Magical Damage]]s. Players had to use a shovel or a light shovel on him and his fellow testers repeatedly in order to kill them. He could be hit once each 20 seconds and each hit deals 5000 damage. If you tried to hit him before this cooldown, you would get the following message {{Server Message|Oh come on, give this poor guy a break!}} You could only get the loot if you hit him at least once.\n\nIf everyone was hitting him, it would take 33 minutes and 20 seconds to kill him.\n\nWhen you hit him, you would need to wait for 60 seconds to gather more strenght to hit him again otherwise you would get the following message {{Server Message|You still need to gather some strength for a good whack.}}\n\n[[File:Tibia's 15th Anniversary!
