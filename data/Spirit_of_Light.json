They were intended to heal players and did that at first, but because of a change to game mechanics, monsters could no longer work in favor of players. They could, however, heal hostile monsters even on [[Optional PvP]]. This was fixed for [[Lightbearer Event]] in 2014, and Spirits of Light can heal players again. Could be killed by summons on the [[Test Server]].<br />\nLooks the same as a [[Wisp]] and a [[Soul Spark]].",
