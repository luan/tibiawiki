You can also use [[Ice Strike]] and your favourite weapon, but considering their high amount of health, that is not recommended unless you're in a party.\n'''[[Knights]]:''' should kill this using [[Berserk]] and [[Blood Rage]] if you're fighting them solo. In a party, rely on your shooters to help you.\n'''[[Paladins]]:''' should run them, but be very careful not to attract more lizards while doing so or you will have a hard time.
