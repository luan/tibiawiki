Instead, run from them and focus on the other creatures in the room, they move very slowly and their damage can easily be avoided.\n\nDuring the early stage of the fight when there are only 1-2 spheres you may be able to lure them to one side of the room while you then run and lure the boss to the other. This can give you around 10 seconds without having to worry about the spheres until they teleport to the center of the room and re target.",
