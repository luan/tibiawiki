    "bestiarytext": "Werebadgers are humans under a curse - others claim infected with a disease - that causes them to transform into savage beasts. At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.\nWerebadgers aren't very strong and tough but quick and clever in compensation. They are no real predators, but may nonetheless be a danger to the careless. Their appearance is a mix between a badger and a human being. Like badgers, Werebadgers favour caverns as homesteads.\nThe curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.",

If possible, bring [[Koshei's Ancient Amulet]] and be ready to cast spells because they become invisible very, very often. They often come in packs so a [[Fire Wall]] or a [[Fire Bomb]] might come in handy in order to avoid having your shielding broken. '''[[Sorcerer]]s''' should also use death damage protection such as [[Robe of the Underworld]], same with '''[[Paladin]]s''' and [[Divine Plate]]. '''[[Druid]]s''' on the other hand are going to struggle against these and all non-paladin players should watch their HP as the damage caused by [[Cursed]] ramps up quickly."
