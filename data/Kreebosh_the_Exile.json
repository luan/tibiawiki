If you are drunk after the battle, equip a [[Dwarven Ring]]. You should also use [[Exori]] and [[Blood Rage]] to kill faster. If you are lucky, he will not summon any [[Green Djinn]]s.<br />\n[[Paladins]]: Run in circles and shoot if he has 2 summoned djinns you may run arround them to avoid get hit by the boss berserk and melee.\nBe careful, because he can summon both djinns at the same time, breaking up your shielding and making powerful combos that might kill you in a second.",
