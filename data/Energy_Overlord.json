Use [[Fierce Berserk]] as often as possible as there is a time limit of two minutes inorder to kill it. Remember that with its high resistance to physical attacks, even a skilled knight can only do 150 damage on average with [[Fierce Berserk]]. It's not likely that you can kill more than one within the two minute time frame (if you are sword-wielding 250-level knight and use Tagralt Blade, you can kill up to 3 Energy Overlords at one time). Keep in mind that it paralyzes often with its [[Wrath of Nature]] attack, so its wise to heal every turn so that you can stay diagonal and avoid the lethal energy beam.\n\nSince [[Summer Update 2009]], it always drops [[Pure Energy]].",
