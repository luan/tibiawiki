Sorcerers can cast a DoT spell such as [[Curse]], followed by going down again is a good idea since the behemoth does not heal. Frequently recasting such a spell when the damage is down to 10 per round can kill the behemoth in about 5-10 minutes without putting yourself in too much danger.<br>\n'''[[Knight]]s''' can solo hunt Behemoths at level 200+ with an ice weapon such as [[Winterblade]] with relative ease and profit as Behemoths are weak to ice damage and otherwise resistant to physical damage. Using '''[[Summon Skullfrost]]''' when hunting Behemoths is very effective as they are weak to both ice and death damage."
