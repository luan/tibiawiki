When Versperoth spawns you have 20 seconds to deal as much damage as possible. After 20 seconds, Versperoth will disappear, and 10+ [[Minion of Versperoth|minions of Versperoth]] will spawn in the room. Versperoth will reappear 10 seconds later. This repeats until either your team or Versperoth dies. Excess minions will disappear after new ones spawn.\n\nWhen Versperoth is in the room, focus fire on it. When it disappears, focus on the minions most threatening to the team. [[Energy Wall]]s can be used to protect shooters but they will cross if they retarget at the right time. Note that Versperoth does not heal itself.",
