Heavily armored and enhanced with magic weaponry, the golems turn into behemoths of destruction. Only their simple-mindedness might be a weakness and hints that in former days the squads of War Golems were probably personally controlled by a Yalahari leader.<br />War Golems are a rare sight. Most are stored away in the quarters of the Yalahari, a few are left and forgotten in abandoned areas of the city.<br />Rumours persist that squads of War Golems were also deployed elsewhere in long forgotten wars. As they were never returned they are said to follow unknown orders of long dead commanders to the present day.",
