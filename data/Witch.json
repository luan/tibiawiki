If you are planning to hunt them, you can summon a [[Fire Elemental]] as a mage.<br /> \n'''Knights''': should just run up to them and kill them. Try to block her in a corner with other objects or monsters, so she can't run away. A knight can kill a Witch with a [[Melee]] [[Skills|Skill]] of 55 very easily, but just watch out for their fire fields, as they can become a pain if killing more than one witch at a time. If you block them in a corner, they will usually stop spamming their fire attacks and use their weak melee instead.<br />\n'''Paladins''': should stand still and kill them from distance."
