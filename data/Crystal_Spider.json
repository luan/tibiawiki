However, the Crystal Spider was affected much more heavily than the frost dragon. Its body drastically changed to a crystalline or rather icy consistence, emitting an enormous cold. Its spiderwebs are not made of silk but of concentrated ice which is extremely cold. The cold alone is sufficient to freeze most creatures to the web which therefore does not need a gluey coating. The poison of the spider is like an injection of pure ice. It painfully freezes the flesh and numbs the extremities. The good resistance to cold that many creatures on the Ice Islands possess makes such advantage, however, redundant. For this reason, Crystal Spiders have specialised in hunting warm blooded creatures that are susceptible to their special abilities. This includes humans, elves and dwarfs. It is unknown if Crystal Spiders can survive in warmer climates. If they were able to adapt to warmer environment where much more prey is available that is susceptible to their attacks, they would easily spread through the lands like a plague.",

    "strategy": "Watch your step!  They are located in smaller areas along with [[Wyvern]]s, [[Ice Golem]]s and other Crystal Spiders, so you may have trouble outrunning them.  Strike hard and fast with a [[Knight]] blocking and have [[Paladin]]s or [[Mage]]s attacking with offensive spells to dispatch it quickly. Soloing them on a [[Knight]] can be risky. [[Mage]]s should use [[exori vis]] and while druids should use a death rod, sorcerers should use an energy wand. Keep in mind they are similar to [[Giant Spider]]s but use weaker melee attacks and paralyze, so running them is not needed. [[Paladin]]s should keep distance and use [[Ethereal Spear]] to kill them quicker therefore lowering the risk of running into other spawns."
