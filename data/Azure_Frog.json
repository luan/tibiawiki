While the green frog is harmless and only a threat to flies and other insects, the aggressive flora and fauna in the South has bred several subspecies of the frog. Distinguishable by eye-catching colours to warn their opponents, they possess a mild but annoying poisonous spittle. Usually they are harmless even if they appear in great numbers, but wounded adventurers who run out of resources face a real threat when stumbling upon a breeding ground of the little amphibians.",
