They are strongly built with flat noses, large pointed ears, goats' legs and horns on their foreheads. Fauns are a slightly roguish but cheerful folk, lovers of wine and dancing, roaming to the music of panpipes, cymbals, castanets and bagpipes, dancing with the nymphs and swan maidens. Wreaths of vine or ivy often circle their heads. Sometimes they drape themselves with cloth, sometimes also with fawn skins. These children of nature show a youthful and graceful aspect but they are also brave and fearless when it comes to defend themselves. In this case, they display the brutal instincts necessary to survive that every creature of the wild possesses. Fauns emerge from mortals' dreams about celebrations, music and dancing.<br><br>Lately, some fauns on Feyrist are tainted by a mysterious, sinister force that is threatening Feyrist as well as the rest of Tibia. They were transformed into dark fauns who are chasing their brethren and visitors to the fae realm alike.",
