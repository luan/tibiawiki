This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

Lacking the hard shells which protect older scarabs and moving rather slowly, they do not pose a too dangerous threat to a well armed warrior. However, in greater numbers they can bring down even a capable foe. Since they usually prefer to remain with their siblings, it is unfortunately not rare to encounter a pack of them at once.",

If you do, then a level 19+ [[wand]]/[[rod]] will help you kill these much faster, if you don't care about the waste. You can also wear any item from the [[Terra Set]] or a [[Silver Amulet]] to avoid the damage from their poison. Mages could also use a melee weapon while rune making or spend mana on [[Haste|hasting]] to get to the Larva faster, as the cave's ground makes you walk slowly."
