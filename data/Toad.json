Later some spawns were added in [[Yalahar]]'s [[Arena and Zoo Quarter]] and [[Zao]], and finally it became a non Premium exclusive creature with the additions of [[Thornfire World Change|the bog temple]] and the [[Tainted Caves]] in the [[Green Claw Swamp]].\n\n==== Convince ====\nAs of November 16, 2011, Toads as well as other poison-causing creatures can no longer be convinced. This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

Ferocious like no other reptile, they develop a berserk rage in every battle. Even without teeth, they can bite with the crushing force of a giant clam or hit the enemy with there long tongues at lightning speed.<br />They use their powerful legs to jump towards their opponents during which they are able to reach astonishing if not frightening speed. Given their ability to slow down opponents and to speed up themselves, it is quite likely that they can cope with almost every opponent in close combat.",

Use [[GFB]] or other area effecting runes to quickly kill larger groups.<br>\nIf you're on ground level of the [[Laguna Islands]], mages can run around for about 20 seconds quickly, lure about 20 toads and some other creatures this way and then use [[GFB]], 2 (or even one) shots can be enough for about 1k exp."
