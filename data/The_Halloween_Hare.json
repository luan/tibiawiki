    "notes": "It spawns every year on October 31 in [[Rookgaard]] and [[Mainland]] since 2006, and in [[Dawnport]] since 2014. The Halloween Hare can neither be harmed, nor does it deal any damage. Therefore it can neither be killed, nor does it drop any loot. When near players it will \"attack\" the area around them occasionally with a non-damaging boulder which will change the appearance of all players in its radius into a [[Vampire]], [[Ghost]], [[Witch]], [[Skeleton]], [[Mummy]], [[Pumpkin head]]. All changes per boulder are the same so all within the radius of one boulder will receive the same costume. This attack also can affect [[NPC]]s and [[creatures]], including itself. You can not use it to train because it won't cause effect in your skills.\n\nYou can take off your costume by watching time on any nearby clock or by taking a swim.\n<noinclude><gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" mode=\"nolines\">\nWhen hares attack.JPG|The \"morphbomb\"\n</gallery></noinclude>",
