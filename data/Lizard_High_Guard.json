    "bestiarytext": "Lizard High Guards are hand-picked former members of the legions who showed great talent or had proven themselves in battle. These individuals were schooled in advanced tactics and put to a series of challenging tests. Joining the Lizard High Guards is a secret ceremony that takes place on the Isle of Strife. It is rumoured that the candidates do not only face several creatures in the arena but also have to battle their inner demons to prove themselves worthy. With the decline of the empire and the dwindling numbers of lizards, these tests became less and less lethal. Still, failure is seen as a dire disgrace and once these unlucky individuals are back in the legions they often seek death in battle to escape their shame.<br />The Lizard High Guards are the elite troops of the empire and fiercely loyal to their superiors following their strict code of honour. Their pride and honour let them stick to any given task, regardless how futile their mission may seem. Failure is no option for a Lizard High Guard. In the army, the Lizard High Guards form an almost monastic order with rituals and an ever present code of behaviour. The ideal Lizard High Guard is expected to be an example of absolute control over its mind and body. Lizard High Guards on ceremonial watch are known to remain so motionless that they could easily pass as statues.   The Lizard High Guards are perfectly aware of their elite status in the society and they look on the ordinary legionnaires with contempt.",
