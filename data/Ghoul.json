    "notes": "This kind of [[Undead]] is found usually in groups and can be dangerous for unexperienced players. Only fight them while wearing good equipment or keeping them at distance, otherwise their melee combined with life drain can do a lot of damage. When summoned, ghouls make good hunting partners because they can heal themselves, a trait that makes them good for training on as well. They are fairly slow so mages and paladins should be able to run and attack. They are commonly used as a summon for [[knight]]s in [[training]], but not so much for [[paladin]]s due to the higher chance of killing them. A level 91 knight and a level 36 paladin can convince these to train. Unlike most of their undead counterparts, Ghouls leave bloodstains when damaged.",
