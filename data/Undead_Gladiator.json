Unlike other undead, his will power and determination let him retain a certain degree of his former self. A few gladiators were even able to stay almost the complete same person considering  personality and intelligence which makes them to especially fearsome opponents. Undead Gladiators can wield a large variety of weapons, and their undead state has even enhanced their fighting skills. Without any moral restraints, immune to pain, and tireless, an Undead Gladiator is a virtual fighting machine that wears down his opponent before he finishes them off in a burst of skilful attacks.<br />Without the need for sleep or food, their existence has turned into a constant battle, a permanent test of their skills. They strive for perfection, but ironically, their undead state prevents them from enhancing their skills further or to train their body. So the emptiness of their existence is haunting them every moment, and feeds the rage and jealousy towards the living.<br />Undead Gladiators often participate in gruesome duels with each other to test their skills in a macabre and tireless dance of death, sometimes lasting for days.",

Because of their high defense, you should use strong weapons, even with high skills.\n'''[[Knight]]s:''' They hit very hard so [[skill]] levels of 80/80 and at least [[level]] 50 and good [[equipment]] is recommended. Only high level knights will profit, so try to get a druid to heal you. If you solo, it's usually wiser to fight 2 at a time instead of one, because you will be using exori/exori gran often just to get some damage through their great defense.  Exori will hit both gladiators and will yield twice the experience for almost the same amount of mana.\n\n'''[[Sorcerer]]s:''' Should use a [[Wand of Starstorm]] or [[Wand of Voodoo]] since these are elements they're weakest to for wands, and use [[Terra Strike]].  If it's too crowded and there are several gladiators on the floor, use [[energy wave]] to clear the groups while running them.  If it gets too tough, you can go between the beds on the bottom floor to narrow them to one direct attack at a time.  Recommended for levels 60+.\n'''[[Druid]]s:''' Should use a [[Springsprout Rod]] and [[Terra Strike]].  The combination will drop the gladiators quite efficiently.  If things get tough with a group of them, use [[Terra Wave]] to clean them out fast.  Recommended for levels 50+. A blocker would be a nice idea."
