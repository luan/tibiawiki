Although enigmatic in their motivation, they are indisputably intelligent and possess an array of spells that centre around water, poison and cold.",

    "strategy": "If you don't have a [[Helmet of the Deep]], stay away from more than two water elementals, because they will drop lots of [[Hitpoints]] in a single combo.

Do not be afraid to use [[Thunderstorm Rune]]s or [[Energy Wave]] when facing three or more. If you are a low level [[Knight]], just run away.<br />\n'''All vocations''': Remember to bring your [[Helmet of the Deep]] when hunting these! It blocks 100% of their strongest attack, the water explosion. The heavy weight of the helmet will be easily compensated as it will save you from their most deadly combos.<br />\n'''Knights''': Stay away from these unless you feel like wasting to get fast exp. They are very resistant to physical. Skill rings are strongly recommended. Stay away from groups as you will waste a lot of potions for the mighty combos they deal. Even [[Fierce Berserk|exori gran]] doesn't hit them for that much damage.<br />\n'''Paladins''': Take your best bow, [[Flash Arrow]]s and potions - kill from a distance while being careful to not lure more than two water elementals.<br />\n'''Sorcerers and Druids''': Easy creature for mid to high level mages with good magic level. [[Sorcerer]] should take [[Wand of Starstorm]], when [[Druid]] can take [[Underworld Rod]] or no rod at all. It should usually be all to bring them down in no time. Alternatively use [[HMM]]s to hit them from afar. They drop strong mana potions quite frequently, which will help you hunting for longer time. [[Glacier Set]] will reduce [[Icicle]] damage, but it is not neccesary. You will need to heal after each hit to make sure you don't die to a higher combo."
