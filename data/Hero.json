Try always fighting one hero at a time using [[exori hur]] and [[exori ico]] to counteract their healing. Wearing equipment with [[Physical Damage|physical protection]] is effective. Unless you're a high level knight who can run from [[spawn]] to spawn and slay multiple heroes with [[exori min]] and [[exori gran]].<br />\n'''[[Mages]]:''' Can start killing heroes solo without mana shield, from about level 60. For level 60+ players, these can be killed moderately easy using a [[Death]] [[Wand]] or [[Rod]] and using [[Death Strike]]. Because they are quite weak [[Death Damage]], they can be killed at lower levels very easily using [[Sudden Death]] runes. Although, this will be harder to profit with. Don't bother summoning anything, you'd spend more time [[Healing Spells|healing]] your summons doing any damage. Try to not use [[Magic Shield]], unless youâ€™re facing more heroes than you can handle. When you are mage level 55+ you can solo these using only exura.<br />\n'''[[Paladins]]:''' Can do as they would with any other creature, run and shoot preferably with some [[spear]]s and a [[Shields|shield]], using [[Ethereal Spear]] to aid in killing them. <br /> \n'''All Vocations''' You can also use [[Dwarven Set]] with all vocations to reduce damage but it will also reduce your capacity as a mage or paladin. <br /> \n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nimage:Heroes 2.gif|A Knight and Druid team.\n</gallery>"
