Those who are not torn into pieces by their merciless brethren or other creatures, grow to enormous, frightening killing machines. Juggernauts are known to be able to slash the head of a dragon with one hit, while fighting back a half-dozen of other dragons. The earth trembles where a Juggernaut walks, heralding the incoming of doom. Seemingly being made up only of armor and muscles, the Juggernaut is incredibly powerful and fast, killing the first opponent and walking to the next in a mere blink. Serving as one-creature armies, the Juggernauts are some of the most powerful weapons at the disposal of the demonlords.",

Also the knight can use [[Protector]] and have 190+ shielding, then the hits go down to an average of 450~ and can heal with [[Wound Cleansing]] and some [[Great Health Potion|great potions]], while the team kills it. They are found in proximity of [[Fury|Furies]], [[Destroyer]]s and [[Demon]]s, so you can't hunt only Juggernauts. The best place to hunt plain Juggernauts would be the single spawn. They are also very fast, but since they have no wave [[attack]]s you can let the blocker [[lure]] them to a small 1sqm wide bridge in the [[Apocalypse]]'s throne room, and just let the shooters attack it with [[SD]]s.  The Juggernaut's boss is [[Massacre]] also located in [[Ruthless Seven|Apocalypse's]] throne room."
