A level 45 with 75/75 would be able to kill these with little waste, although 85/85 is the ideal skill range. You might want use [[Berserk]] in case you become surrounded by these.<br>\n\n'''[[Paladin]]s''': Can kill these at low [[level]]s because they are slow and don't have [[Distance Fighting|distance attacks]]. But if you get trapped by other [[creatures]] then you will die fast. Using [[GFB]] should help to prevent this.<br>\n\n'''[[Mage]]s''': Similar to the paladins, using [[wand]]s or [[rod]]s of [[Fire Damage|fire]]/[[death Damage]]. On higher levels, with a good [[magic level]], you should use the level 33+ wands/rods and, if [[Premium Account]] use [[Flame Strike]]. A mage of level 35 and magic level 45 is recommended for those who wish not to waste."
