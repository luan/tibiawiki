Being bad fighters, they use their tools, gadgets and inventions as dangerous weapons.  Protective about their secrets and fearing punishment for their amoral experiments, they tend to attack outsiders on sight.<br />Mad Scientists often join confraternities with other scientists to profit from more resources. Others find employment by unscrupulous beings that fund their researches in exchange for their services. Most of them are too absorbed in their researches to become leaders themselves.  Some, however, are worldly enough to hire minions and plan and coordinate operations as the scientific mastermind.",
