Be careful while trapping him, because you might lure more cult members on yourself (they rarely appear alone). As a [[paladin]] you should lure single adept (for easier and safer killing) and kill shooting [[bolts]] with help of [[HMM]] runes whenever they go invisible. Easiest way to hunt them with mages is to summon [[Demon Skeleton]] as a blocker. All adepts' ranged attacks are life drain type, which won't affect [[Demon Skeleton]]. Just lure adept on your summon, and kill him using any runes. Keep in mind that if you start attacking with wand, summon will follow adept which may lead to luring more monsters - try to make your summon stand still. Watch your [[hp]] carefully, and try to heal whenever it drops lower than 350 - adepts can deal some nasty combos with some additional damage from summons. Don't kill [[ghoul]]s he summons, rather focus all your firepower on adept. Don't forget about [[Dwarven Ring]]s, being drunk is something you want to avoid if you need to run. Having a few area attack runes might be good idea if you'll have to face more cult members. Also, bringing one or two [[Garlic Necklace]] might be a good idea since their [[Life Drain]] can reduce your HP rather fast."
