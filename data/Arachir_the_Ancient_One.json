Then use either [[Hell's Core]] ([[Sorcerers]]) or [[Eternal Winter]] ([[Druids]]) to kill this vampire lord and it's summoned [[Lich]]es. \n\nHigher levels can successfully kill this boss alone with help of field runes like [[Energy Bomb]]s or [[Energy Wall]]s, to keep summones [[Lich]]es or eventual [[Vampire]]s from attacking you.",
