Still trapped in their lust for revenge, they mindlessly attack everything they encounter. Mercy is no option and its futile to argue with these maddened ghosts. Their broken and twisted minds are constantly tormented by the ever-present memory of their gruesome death. Entrapped in their feelings and memories, they only find relief when inflicting some of those feelings on living beings. In an insane surge of joy, they attack the life force of others, feeding their pain and amplifying it by projecting their own agony and horror upon their victims. It is said that those who survived the attacks of a Betrayed Wraith are driven insane, they age before their time and turn into white-haired shadows of their former selves.",

A medium level knight should have no problem blocking it as it's attacks aren't extremely powerful, however you will need 3-4 shooters (preferably [[Paladin]]s, as [[Mage]]s cannot deal much damage to these creatures), otherwise you will be wasting a lot of supplies. Be wary when group hunting, they will retarget relentlessly. Also, higher level paladins could kill them solo using [[Assassin Star]]s and [[Divine Missile]]. Try to stay always diagonal when killing it solo as a paladin, since the poison wave decreases 95% of your distance fighting for about 3-5 seconds."
