You may need to use [[Light Healing]] or [[Intense Healing]] when your health drops below 150. This creature uses [[Haste]] making it difficult to outrun, not recommended for level 20 or below. You should bring [[Mana Potion]]s as a precaution for lower levels.\n\n'''[[Paladins]]''': Just run around and kill it with [[Royal Spear]]s. When it hastes, keep running and heal with [[Light Healing|Exura]] or [[Intense Healing|Exura Gran]]. You might need some [[Mana potions]] for lower levels.\n\n'''[[Knights]]''': Stand still and kill it using [[Melee]]. It is strong to [[Physical Damage]], so it is recommended to use a fire-enchanted weapon. Knights with skills 60/60 or more shouldn't have a problem killing Hide, but it is recommended to take mana potions for [[Wound Cleansing]].",
