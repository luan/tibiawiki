This chance will keep on increasing further with every kill until they loot a bag from him. Then, the drop chance returns to its original value which is considerably lower than the increased first-kill chance. Each time they subsequently defeat him without receiving a bag, the chances increase again untill their next drop.\n\nBakragore has four progenies, two pairs of twins which were split from him: [[Murcion]] & [[Ichgahal]], and [[Chagorz]] & [[Vemiath]].",
