    "notes": "'''Madareth''' has dedicated his life to battle. Bred by [[The Ruthless Seven]] as one of their greatest warlords, '''Madareth''' has endured a painful and torturing training. Instead of creating a brilliant leader, though, they gave birth to a savage killing machine that constantly tries to improve his skills by challenging other demonic minions. Even if '''Madareth''' only uses a fraction of his skills, the usual outcome of such fights is a stack of [[Juggernaut]]s and demons hacked to pieces. It is rumoured that he even defeated the mighty [[Orshabaal]]. His only weakness might be the single-mindedness with which he pursues the destruction of his victims. In his lust for battle, he often forgets his surrounding and lives only for the moment of his next strike. Though '''Madareth''' loves playing cat and mouse with his victims, he quickly loses all finesse and fully indulges in his blood lust. It is unknown how such a beast is kept in check by [[The Ruthless Seven]].\n\n{{JSpoiler|It's one of the bosses of [[The Inquisition Quest]].}}",

Trap him in a corner using the geography of the area and the blockers - ready to heal themselves and [[Challenge]], because '''Madareth''' often retargets - while [[Mage]]s [[summon]] [[Fire Devil]]s to attack with [[Fire Damage|Fire-Based Attacks]]. NOTE that it's POSSIBLE to solo this creature with a [[Paladin]] wearing [[Assassin Star]]s and [[Ethereal Spear]], with good skills and around level 250+. Be careful though, if he will get to you, you may take a nice combo so keep distance at all costs.",
