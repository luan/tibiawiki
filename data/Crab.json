In fact Crabs live on the beach or in the sea. Their natural armour is very thick and their pinchers are suited to crush shells. Obviously, Crabs are well prepared to defend themselves and they surely will if they feel threatened. Usually they try to scare away intruders from their territory, but they do not pursuit trespassers for long. The taste of their flesh is rather unusual but not bad, some call it even a delicacy.",
