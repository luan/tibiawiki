    "bestiarytext": "When the long forgotten ancestors of modern necromancers in dark caves sang their ritual chants, those ancient priests of death often rose one of the most fearsome beasts their race had to handle. They focused their powers to raise the mighty Undead Cavebear to unlife. This vicious beast was one of the masters that used to rule the mountains of old.<br />In unlife it is bent to the will of their summoners and spreads fear and death in the ranks of their enemies. An Undead Cavebear used to be not only a tool and minion, it was a symbol of status and leadership, not unlike a sceptre. Once an integral part of necromancy, the primal powers that aroused the Undead Cavebears from death have been forgotten and discarded in favour of more subtle magic that allowed more complicated creations.<br />In modern times the questionable honour of rediscovering the incantations belongs to ambitious researchers of the past. The bones they unburied and that belonged to powerful ancient necromantic priests were stolen and served as paraphernalia to summon ancient spirits and teach modern necromancers their arts. The raw and archaic enchantments quickly spread through the ranks of modern necromancers and so more and more Undead Cavebears are seen again as minions of death. As rumours go, the 'modern' Undead Cavebears are joined with some ancient constructs that somewhere withstood the ravages of time thanks to their robust nature and powerful enchantments.",
