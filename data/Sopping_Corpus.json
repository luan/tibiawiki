    "bestiarytext": "The Sopping Corpuses, unlike their brethren, are the only semi-undead rot creatures in the fallen realm that retain remnants of their original dark souls embedded within. These cursed entities are eternal prisoners of the decay that befell their withering bodies, forever trapped in a state of half-life. Their forms, ravaged by time and decay, exude an aura of despair and sorrow, as if their tortured existence weighs heavily upon their rotting souls. Their movements are slow and agonizing, their bodies oozing with a mixture of decaying matter and a sinister, otherworldly essence. The Sopping Corpuses emit pitiful moans and wails, their voices carrying the anguish of lost souls trapped in an unending cycle of decay and torment. Those who encounter these pitiable creatures cannot help but feel a sense of profound sadness and pity for their cursed existence.",
