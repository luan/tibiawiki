His beams cause [[Mana Drain|mana drain]], [[Electrified|electrification]] and [[burning]], making him easier for knights to block. If trapped, Gnomevil's damage can be countered with relative ease. The general strategy is to have 3-4 players (preferably knights) block Gnomevil's adjacent squares and have the shooters fire until he's dead. The player being attacked by Gnomevil (usually the highest level mage) should position themselves behind the main blocking knight, so that Gnomevil is most commonly facing them, absorbing the beams for the other knights to save mana. [[Challenge]] is probably a bad idea while Gnomevil is trapped because it would direct strong melee damage to the knight for a single turn, before Gnomevil again retargets to the highest damage dealer.\n\nFor small team,it's recommended to trap boss where he spawn with 1 or 2 blockers and all shooters should stay north west of boss,this way boss wont chase them if one of blockers stand 1sqm north of his spawn position.",
