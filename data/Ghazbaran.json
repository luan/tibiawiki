Simply trap the Knight blocking the [[Deathslicer]] with Magic Walls and then attack the Knight with the summons to kill the [[Deathslicer]].) and other knights (about 3) to block Ghazbaran ([[Stone Skin Amulet]]s are strongly recommended, cause this powerful creature can even kill a [[knight]] of [[level]] 200+ with one [[combo]]). The main blocker will need a lot of healers, usually some blockers die trying to block with their own healing. The main blocker can also use [[Challenge]] to make sure Ghazbaran does not retarget on the shooters and healers. Then, just have many shooters to banish the Archdemon from our realm.
