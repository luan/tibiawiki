    "notes": "When you look at a summoned Paladin Familiar, you will see the summoner's character name and how long it will take for the summon to disappear. It can be summoned by [[Paladin]]s of level 200 or higher, by saying the magic words:Â ''Utevo gran res sac'' [[Summon Paladin Familiar]]. All the experience that is expected to be 'gained' by the summon goes to the player. So there is no shared exp between your summon and its summoner, like with the normal [[Summon Creature]] spell.\n\nIt will follow players at their speed and will go up and down stairs and holes with them. It lasts for 15 minutes with a 30 minutes cooldown. It can go with you to a protection zone. If you logout, it will disappear stopping the countdown of its timer, and will reappear when you login again.",
