    "strategy": "Be very careful when running or hunting in the [[Guzzlemaw Valley]] if there are Sights of Surrenders spawning. Not only they deal considerable damage, their huge health pool and high self healing means they take a long time to die. They are not worth hunting for Experience, but if in case you decide to kill them during regular hunts or for loot, a minimum of 2 players is recommended to take them down faster. Avoid staying in front of them and mind the other creatures in the area. It's usually best to first clear everything around it using AoE attacks and them focus on the Sight of Surrender using single target attacks."
