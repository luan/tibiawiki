This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

This is the fastest monster you can face in Rookgaard."
