Sages have already wondered if such an unusual creature can be natural or if it rather has its source in evil wizardry. On the other hand, nests of Terror Birds have been found, so this theory does not seem to be very likely. Be that as it may, the name of this feared hunter is more than justified. The aggressive bird attacks everything that comes in its sight with rage that does indeed inspire fear and dread. The carnivorous Terror Bird seems to regard everything as its rightful prey and its sharp beak often proves it right. Its inability to fly is made up by strong muscular legs that allow the bird to run at an astonishing speed and that serve also well as additional weapons.",
