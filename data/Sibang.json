They use their incredible agility to attack enemies from a safe distance and to swiftly evade counter-attacks. Their hit-and-run tactic proves especially effective in the familiar territory of the jungle. Attacking suddenly from the cover of trees, they throw volleys of different projectiles and then retreat to safety to prepare for their next attack. Ever curious and adventurous, they are the apes that are most often away from their homes. Sometimes they serve as scouts and spies to prepare a bigger assault. Using trees like humans are using roads, it is nearly impossible to catch them.",

Using a shield is highly recommended in either case due to the presence of [[Kongra]]s nearby.<br>'''[[Druid]]s and [[Sorcerer]]s''' should use [[Ice Strike]] and [[Wand of Decay]]/[[Necrotic Rod]] or [[Hailstorm Rod]]. [[Ice Wave]] can also be effective as sibangs are within its range. Chasing not recommended as you risk being swarmed by more [[apes]]. They can move items that are in their way. Take advantage of the buildings in [[Banuta]], and try to trap them in corners."
