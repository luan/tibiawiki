This was to prevent PvP abuse whereby a player would trick another player into convincing creatures that would later frag low level characters with poison applied earlier. After enough kills the player would obtain a [[Red Skull]] and would lose all items belonging to them upon being killed.

Typically found in their underground lairs, they also inhabit sacred places such as temples or tombs. Scarabs protect their charge with ferocious intent. They will attack anyone who dares to intrude their area and will not relent until the threat is eliminated. Their shells are immensely hard and sometimes weapons might get caught in their chitinous armor. They are able to concentrate their poison in a deadly cloud of nauseating fumes that especially cover their retreat if overwhelmed.",
