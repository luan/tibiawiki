They are good for mages using wands as with full defense and basic equipment they practically don't damage you. They also stand at an ideal range (4 squares away) to be hit by wave attacks like [[Ice Wave|Ice]] and [[Fire Wave]]. This can be a mana-conservative way to kill multiple Amazons at once. Knights should just charge and slay using melee but beware of luring large amounts."
