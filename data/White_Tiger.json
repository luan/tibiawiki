    "bestiarytext": "White tigers are unique on the island of Oskayaat. There, they stalk through the jungle, looking for prey. They strike by surprise, quickly and deadly. Fast and lethal, those fighting machines are a hurricane of teeth and claws when it comes to combat. Like all tigers they are solitary creatures, although small tiger families are not an uncommon view. Even though they are mostly hunting smaller mammals of the jungle, sometimes they are also after larger prey. They easily feel threatened and like most warlike creatures, they react on threats with violence.",
