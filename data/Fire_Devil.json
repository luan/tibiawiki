You can kill Fire Devils fairly easily with [[Ice Damage|ice attacks]], but if you have no ice attacks then [[Death Damage|death attacks]] should be your next choice, as they have less resistance to death than to other elements. [[Magic Shield]] may also be helpful.<br />\nIf you are a [[Paladin]] with skills of 40 or higher and some healing potions, it should be  easy for you to kill Fire Devils, if you are using a shield you can try to trap them, this way they will use their melee and do less distance attacks."
