To reduce the waste, you can use [[Enchanted Spear]], because it has a stronger attack and is hard to break. The [[Divine Missile]] spell works great against Demon Skeletons. Have a [[Divine Healing]] spell ready to use if they actually touch you.<br>\nA '''[[Druid]]''' or '''[[Sorcerer]]''' should either use [[Heavy Magic Missile]]s or [[Energy strike]], perhaps combined with an appropriate [[Wand]] or [[Rod]]. The [[Invisible]] spell is also useful and can save your life, since they can not see invisible creatures.<br> A [[Druid]] of [[level]] 35 or more can get much [[experience]] killing demon skeletons with [[Hailstorm Rod]] while being [[Invisible]]. [[Sorcerer]]s can do the same thing but with a [[Wand of Cosmic Energy]] or [[Wand of Starstorm]]."
