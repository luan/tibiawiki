    "notes": "When you look at a summoned Knight Familiar, you will see the summoner's character name and how long it will take for the summon to disappear. They can be summoned by [[Knight]]s of level 200 or higher, by saying the words: ''Utevo gran res eq'' [[Summon Skullfrost]]. All the experience that is expected to be 'gained' by the summon goes to the player. So there is no shared exp between your summon and you, like normal [[Summon Creature]] spell.\n\nIt will follow players at their speed and will go up and down stairs and holes with them. It lasts for 15 minutes with a 30 minutes cooldown. It can go with you to a protection zone. If you logout, it will disappear stopping the countdown of its timer, and will reappear when you login again.",
