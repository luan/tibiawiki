Her body is not ethereal like that of a ghost, but her burning gaze and the withering look of infinite pain in her face strike terror in every mortal's heart. Even worse than her fearsome looks, however, is her unworldly song. The Banshee's wail is a melody of pure death which drains her unfortunate victims of all life and hope. Few mortals who have encountered a Banshee have lived to tell the tale.",

Trying to take on more than one banshee at a time can be dangerous and is not recommended for lower levels. [[Demon Skeleton]]s can be useful to help blocking and killing.<br />\n[[Paladin]]s need space to run and use healing spells to remove paralysis.Be prepared to use your [[Divine Caldera]] if you get swarmed by them.<br>[[Knight]]s could use a two handed weapon to kill fast, most damage you will take, comes from life drain. You can attempt them from skills 65/65 and level 50 on. Be ready to use 3-4 strong health potions and 7-8 mana potions to exori it down."
