It will fail if Gaz'haragoth has no room to summon.\n*{{Sound|Gaz'haragoth beginns to draw on the nightmares to HEAL himself!}} - In about 8 seconds Gaz'haragoth will heal himself for 300,000.

    "strategy": "Gaz'haragoth has a large energy UE which is announced 5 seconds prior to its execution. He also spawns many [[Minion of Gaz'haragoth|minions of Gaz'haragoth]] which act independently of the boss. Care must be taken when walking in Gaz'haragoth's lair as the minions turn into [[Strange Vortex (Teleporter)|Strange Vortices]] which lead to [[Gaz'haragoth's Nightmare]].\n\nThe strategy to defeat Gaz'haragoth is very similar whether he's on top of the mountain of locked in the prison, with the obvious difference that when it's fought for the first time the players will certainly be much lower levels. \n\nLure Gaz'haragoth to a corner, preferably near one of the ramps to give the shooters a quick means to escape. When Gaz'haragoth is lured, trap him with [[Magic Wall]]s and [[Wild Growth]] but allow room for Gaz'haragoth to summon 1 or more [[Minion of Gaz'haragoth|minions of Gaz'haragoth]]. When the boss is trapped, kill the minion so that the luring knight can escape (on [[Open PvP]] servers, you can also simply walk through someone else's wall). When the knight is out, try to trap Gaz'haragoth so he can't move at all. When he is trapped, focus all of your firepower on the boss. The trick is that when he drops to about 12.5% of his health, he will use the [[Nightmare of Gaz'haragoth|nightmares]] to heal himself. At this point, you have 8 seconds to deal approximately 44,000 damage. If you fail, he will heal for 300,000.\n\nHigh level Knights (700+) can also attempt to block Gaz'haragoth as long as they have healers and are prepared to flee from Death and Doom. To attempt that, the recommended strategy is to block it near the ramp so shooters can easily go up and down, as well make sure there's a vortex to the Nightmare nearby to escape. It's very important to mind its heavy paralyze when trying to run away, or you may not do so in time. \n\nThere may be another way to kill this boss because servers with low population will struggle to defeat him before he heals. In particular, one of the announcements seem to hint that the [[Nightmare of Gaz'haragoth|nightmares]] can be killed to prevent his heal.",
