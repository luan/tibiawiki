Lower level mages can summon [[demon skeleton]]s, as it is much safer to make the Necromancer target them. While killing a few Necromancers at once, you should be careful, as they can surround fairly quickly with summons and while hitting you from distance. <br />\nHigher level [[Mage]]s need only hunt these by using [[Strong Mana Potion]]s, as you'll only need to use [[Flame Strike]] and [[exura]]. But be careful, if you run into a spawn with 2-3 necros they can still easily trap you with their summons and that could result in a lot of mana being wasted. Try to stand still and use [[Fire Wave]] since they will keep exactly 4 sqm distance from you which makes it easy to defeat up to 5 necros with a few waves.<br />\n\n'''[[Knights]]''' of approximately level 70+ can easily hunt these creatures after the [[Summer Update 2007]]. Just run up to them and melee them using [[exura ico]] and [[Soft Boots]], you will need very little [[Strong Health Potion]]s or [[Great Health Potion]]s like this.<br />\n\n'''[[Paladins]]''' can also use this strategy to kill Necromancers, except that they have to stay at a distance and maybe run around to avoid being hit by it's summons."
