While some of their race still serves his brother Uman, who had a hand in their creation, a good part of them defected to the service of Zathroth when the world was still young. Seekers and preservers of knowledge to the core of their very essence is bound to the principles of Uman-Zathroth. The energuardians are extremely intelligent, with several independent brain spheres that by choice can work separately or in unison. They are constantly occupied with several projects at once and only a few spheres of them sleep at the same time. Even in face of mortal threat they are usually distracted by 'more urgent' matters. Still dangerous and powerful, it's hard to tell what potential an energuardian could unleash, if he'd ever focussed on a single issue like a fight.<br />\nThough in general very reasonable, the energuardians are also devout followers of Zathroth and very strict in heeding their obligations. They are aware of their status, power and knowledge and behave extremely arrogant and dismissive towards other races and underlings.<br />\nEach of them possesses a unique personal book that is no book at all but rather a scrying device which can display the contents of any other book it memorised and access books stored in the personal book of another energuardian within a certain radius. Each of those books is connected to the books of each other guardian and through willpower they can send written messages to the books of other energuardians. This form of communication has become so popular to their kind, that it completely replaced spoken language within their whole race. Only reluctantly they use their underdeveloped speech organs to communicate with lesser creatures.",
