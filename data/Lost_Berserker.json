Their masters often bind their weapons to their hands, since the lost beserkers tend to forget to use them in the heat of battle and often try to overpower their foes through clawing and biting. Gnomish troops that took enemy bases by surprise told stories that the lost beserkers are held in what resembles high security prisons chained in iron, deprived from sound and vision by leathery masks. More than other Lost they are focused on battle and carnage. Even other Lost, accustomed to injuries, wars and infighting tend to avoid them. Sometimes their bloodlust is so great that they begin to fight each other even in the midst of battle.",
