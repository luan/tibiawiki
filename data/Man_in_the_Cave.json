Once roped a message will appear: <br>{{Sound|You have been roped up!}}.\n\nThe [[Man in the Cave]] was started from a {{Thread|1344512|post}} on the [[Tibia Forum]]s in August 2006 by a player on [[Luminera]] named Frack'Heart (now deleted). Apparently Frack'Heart was complaining about a player in the [[Kazordoon]] [[Dwarf Mines]] who was roping creatures. His English skills were far from advanced, therefore the post was hard to understand.\n\nHe is also the only creature known to drop the [[Fur Cap]].\n\n''See also:'' {{OfficialNewsArchive|3516|C.G.B. â€“ Top Secret}}\n\n<noinclude><gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nMIC.jpg|Man in the Cave on [[Antica]]\nMan in the Cave for Tibia Wiki.jpg|Man in the cave on [[Unitera]]\nmaninthekejv.PNG|Man in the Cave on Refugia\nMan in the Cave Monks.png|You can hear the monks if you're standing exactly under his room. \n</gallery></noinclude>",

Since Frack'Heart's English was so bad, people got confused, missinformed and just flamed him. \n\nThe [[Tibia.com]] Featured Article of April, 2016, was about the myth of the Man in the Cave. You can read the article {{OfficialNewsArchive|3516|here}}.\n\n==== Discovery of Man in the Cave ====\nReports by [http://www.tibia.com/community/?subtopic=characters&name=Chaotic+Sorcerer Chaotic Sorcerer] on Luminera said that he spawns in the Svargrond Mines and that he only found the spawn by chance. Chaotic was just exploring formorgar glacier with a friend when suddenly he saw the orange text. \"You have been roped\"...\n\n[[File:ManinCave1.jpg|300px]]",
